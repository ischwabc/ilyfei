When you take the test, you will be presented with two Issue topics from this pool. The wording of some topics in the test might vary slightly from what is presented here. Therefore, read your test topics carefully and respond to the wording as it appears in the actual test. Present your perspective on the issue below, using relevant reasons and&#x2F;or examples to support your views. “Important truths begin as outrageous, or at least uncomfortable, attacks upon the accepted wisdom of the time.” ——————————————— “Originality does not mean thinking something that was never thought before; it means putting old ideas together in new ways.” ——————————————— “Laws should not be rigid or fixed. Instead, they should be flexible enough to take account of various circumstances, times, and places.” ——————————————— “It is always an individual who is the impetus for innovation; the details may be worked out by a team, but true innovation results from the enterprise and unique perception of an individual.” ——————————————— “The function of science is to reassure; the purpose of art is to upset. Therein lies the value of each.” ——————————————— “The study of an academic discipline alters the way we perceive the world. After studying the discipline, we see the same world as before, but with different eyes.” ——————————————— “It is possible to pass laws that control or place limits on people’s behavior, but legislation cannot reform human nature. Laws cannot change what is in people’s hearts and minds.” ——————————————— “What most human beings really want to attain is not knowledge, but certainty. Gaining real knowledge requires taking risks and keeping the mind open—but most people prefer to be reassured rather than to learn the complex and often unsettling truth about anything.” ——————————————— “Many problems of modern society cannot be solved by laws and the legal system because moral behavior cannot be legislated.” ——————————————— “The way students and scholars interpret the materials they work with in their academic fields is more a matter of personality than of training. Different interpretations come about when people with different personalities look at exactly the same objects, facts, data, or events and see different things.” ——————————————— “It is dangerous to trust only intelligence.” ——————————————— “As we acquire more knowledge, things do not become more comprehensible, but more complex and more mysterious.” ——————————————— “It is a grave mistake to theorize before one has data.” ——————————————— “Scandals—whether in politics, academia, or other areas—can be useful. They focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could.” ——————————————— “Practicality is now our great idol, which all powers and talents must serve. Anything that is not obviously practical has little value in today’s world.” ——————————————— “It is easy to welcome innovation and accept new ideas. What most people find difficult, however, is accepting the way these new ideas are put into practice.” ——————————————— “Success, whether academic or professional, involves an ability to survive in a new environment and, eventually, to change it.” ——————————————— “If people disregard the great works of the past, it is because these works no longer answer the needs of the present.” ——————————————— “As long as people in a society are hungry or out of work or lack the basic skills needed to survive, the use of public resources to support the arts is inappropriate—and, perhaps, even cruel—when one considers all the potential uses of such money.” ——————————————— “Education should be equally devoted to enriching the personal lives of students and to training students to be productive workers.” ——————————————— “Success in any realm of life comes more often from taking chances or risks than from careful and cautious planning.” ——————————————— “It is not the headline-making political events but the seldom-reported social tranformations that have the most lasting significance.” ——————————————— “The best preparation for life or a career is not learning to be competitive, but learning to be cooperative.” ——————————————— “The goal of politics should not be the pursuit of an ideal, but rather the search for common ground and reasonable consensus.” ——————————————— “Technology creates more problems than it solves, and may threaten or damage the quality of life.” ——————————————— “The material progress and well-being of one country are necessarily connected to the material progress and well-being of all other countries.” ——————————————— “Instead of encouraging conformity, society should show greater appreciation of individual differences.” ——————————————— “Truly innovative ideas do not arise from groups of people, but from individuals. When groups try to be creative, the members force each other to compromise and, as a result, creative ideas tend to be weakened and made more conventional. Most original ideas arise from individuals working alone.” ——————————————— “The most elusive knowledge is self-knowledge, and it is usually acquired through solitude, rather than through interaction with others.” ——————————————— “The purpose of education should be to provide students with a value system, a standard, a set of ideas—not to prepare them for a specific job.” ——————————————— “Unlike great thinkers and great artists, the most effective political leaders must often yield to public opinion and abandon principle for the sake of compromise.” ——————————————— “The best way to understand the character of a society is to examine the character of the men and women that the society chooses as its heroes or its heroines.” ——————————————— “We learn through direct experience; to accept a theory without experiencing it is to learn nothing at all.” ——————————————— “As societies all over the world have more and more access to new information, the effects on life-long learning can only be positive.” ——————————————— “People are too quick to take action; instead they should stop to think of the possible consequences of what they might do.” ——————————————— “Rituals and ceremonies help define a culture. Without them, societies or groups of people have a diminished sense of who they are.” ——————————————— “The way people look, dress, and act reveals their attitudes and interests. You can tell much about a society’s ideas and values by observing the appearance and behavior of its people.” ——————————————— “Progress is best made through discussion among people who have contrasting points of view.” ——————————————— “Most people choose a career on the basis of such pragmatic considerations as the needs of the economy, the relative ease of finding a job, and the salary they can expect to make. Hardly anyone is free to choose a career based on his or her natural talents or interest in a particular kind of work.” ——————————————— “Any decision-whether made by government, by a corporation, or by an individual person-must take into account future conditions more than present conditions.” ——————————————— “If a goal is worthy, then any means taken to attain it is justifiable.” ——————————————— “Too much emphasis has been placed on the need for students to challenge the assertions of others. In fact, the ability to compromise and work with others—that is, the ability to achieve social harmony—should be a major goal in every school.” ——————————————— “Society should identify those children who have special talents and abilities and begin training them at an early age so that they can eventually excel in their areas of ability. Otherwise, these talents are likely to remain undeveloped.” ——————————————— “The bombardment of visual images in contemporary society has the effect of making people less able to focus clearly and extensively on a single issue over a long period of time.” ——————————————— “Most important discoveries or creations are accidental: it is usually while seeking the answer to one question that we come across the answer to another.” ——————————————— “In order to produce successful original work, scholars and scientists must first study the successful work of others to learn what contributions remain to be made.” ——————————————— “In order for any work of art—whether film, literature, sculpture, or a song—to have merit, it must be understandable to most people.” ——————————————— “Now that computer technology has made possible the rapid accessing of large amounts of factual information, people are less likely than ever to think deeply or originally. They feel unable to compete with—much less contribute to—the quantity of information that is now available electronically.” ——————————————— “The increase in knowledge is forcing people to specialize. As a result, the distance between fields of specialization has become so vast that specialists in different areas are rarely able to influence each other.” ——————————————— “The chief benefit of the study of history is to break down the illusion that people in one period of time are significantly different from people who lived at any other time in history.” ——————————————— “Learning for learning’s sake is an outdated concept. Today, education must serve an ulterior purpose and be directed toward clear goals.” ——————————————— “Education is primarily a personal matter; it has little to do with school or college.” ——————————————— “Censorship is rarely, if ever, justified.” ——————————————— “People often look for similarities, even between very different things, and even when it is unhelpful or harmful to do so. Instead, a thing should be considered on its own terms; we should avoid the tendency to compare it to something else.” ——————————————— “People are mistaken when they assume that the problems they confront are more complex and challenging than the problems faced by their predecessors. This illusion is eventually dispelled with increased knowledge and experience.” ——————————————— “To remain vigorous, any academic field needs to be led by truly independent thinkers who are willing to ignore established boundaries and challenge long-standing assumptions.” ——————————————— “The best way to teach—whether as an educator, employer, or parent—is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones.” ——————————————— “The best way to learn a new subject or skill is to study small segments or details in great depth rather than to start by trying to develop a sense of the whole.” ——————————————— “College students—and people in general—prefer to follow directions rather than make their own decisions. Therefore, colleges should eliminate as many choices as possible in order to offer students clear direction.” ——————————————— “ ‘Moderation in all things’ is ill-considered advice. Rather, one should say, ‘Moderation in most things,’ since many areas of human concern require or at least profit from intense focus.” ——————————————— “The purpose of education should be to create an academic environment that is separate from the outside world. This kind of environment is ideal because it allows students to focus on important ideas without being held back by practical concerns.” ——————————————— “Although innovations such as video, computers, and the Internet seem to offer schools improved methods for instructing students, these technologies all too often distract from real learning.” ——————————————— “Most people prefer restrictions and regulations to absolute freedom of choice, although they would probably deny such a preference.” ——————————————— “Most people are taught that loyalty is a virtue. But loyalty—whether to one’s friends, to one’s school or place of employment, or to any institution—is all too often a destructive rather than a positive force.” ——————————————— “Encouraging young people to believe that they can accomplish great things if they try hard enough is both misleading and potentially harmful.” ——————————————— “Computers and video technology can make facsimiles of original works such as paintings and historical documents available to everyone. The great advantage of this new technology is that it will enable anyone—not just scholars—to conduct in-depth research without having access to the original works.” ——————————————— “Conformity almost always leads to a deadening of individual creativity and energy.” ——————————————— “Much of the information that people assume is ‘factual’ actually turns out to be inaccurate. Thus, any piece of information referred to as a ‘fact’ should be mistrusted since it may well be proven false in the future.” ——————————————— “Although it is easy to respond positively to the work of another person or group, it is far more worthwhile to give negative feedback.” ——————————————— “An individual’s greatness cannot be judged objectively by his or her contemporaries; the most objective evaluators of a person’s greatness are people who belong to a later time.” ——————————————— “Societies should try to save every plant and animal species, regardless of the expense to humans in effort, time, and financial well-being.” ——————————————— “The true value of a civilization is reflected in its artistic creations rather than in its scientific accomplishments.” ——————————————— “Most societies do not take their greatest thinkers seriously, even when they claim to admire them.” ——————————————— “We can usually learn much more from people whose views we share than from people whose views contradict our own; disagreement can cause stress and inhibit learning.” ——————————————— “Competition is ultimately more beneficial than detrimental to society.” ——————————————— “It is more important to allocate money for immediate, existing social problems than to spend it on long-term research that might help future generations.” ——————————————— “No field of study can advance significantly unless outsiders bring their knowledge and experience to that field of study.” ——————————————— “A nation should require all its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college rather than allow schools in different parts of the nation to determine which academic courses to offer.” ——————————————— “The most effective way to understand contemporary culture is to analyze the trends of its youth.” ——————————————— “The video camera provides such an accurate and convincing record of contemporary life that it has become a more important form of documentation than written records.” ——————————————— “It is often necessary, even desirable, for political leaders to withhold information from the public.” ——————————————— “Academic disciplines have become so specialized in recent years that scholars’ ideas reach only a narrow audience. Until scholars can reach a wider audience, their ideas will have little use.” ——————————————— “Governments must ensure that their major cities receive the financial support they need in order to thrive, because it is primarily in cities that a nation’s cultural traditions are preserved and generated.” ——————————————— “All nations should help support the development of a global university designed to engage students in the process of solving the world’s most persistent social problems.” ——————————————— “People’s attitudes are determined more by their immediate situation or surroundings than by any internal characteristic.” ——————————————— “Many of the world’s lesser-known languages are being lost as fewer and fewer people speak them. The governments of countries in which these languages are spoken should act to prevent such languages from becoming extinct.” ——————————————— “It is necessary for everyone to read poetry, novels, mythology and other types of imaginative literature.” ——————————————— “The stability of a society depends on how it responds to the extremes of human behavior.” ——————————————— “Although many people think that the luxuries and conveniences of contemporary life are entirely harmless, in fact, they actually prevent people from developing into truly strong and independent individuals.” ——————————————— “There are two types of laws: just and unjust. Every individual in a society has a responsibility to obey just laws and, even more importantly, to disobey and resist unjust laws.” ——————————————— “Only by being forced to defend an idea against the doubts and contrasting views of others does one really discover the value of that idea.” ——————————————— “If a society is to thrive, it must put its own overall success before the well-being of its individual citizens.” ——————————————— “National governments should devote more of their social programs and services to children than to adults.” ——————————————— “Reform is seldom brought about by people who are concerned with their own reputation and social standing. Those who are really in earnest about reforming a government, an educational system, or any other institution must be willing to be viewed with disdain by the rest of the world.” ——————————————— “Many people believe that a few individuals or small groups (family, friends, teachers, celebrities, for example) have caused them to think and behave in the way they do. Yet it is always society as a whole that defines us and our attitudes, not a few individuals.” ——————————————— “Contemporary technology makes available many small pieces of factual information. As a result, people have become so preoccupied with bits of fragmented information that they pay too little attention to the larger issues and overall perspectives.” ——————————————— “People in positions of power are most effective when they exercise caution and restraint in the use of that power.” ——————————————— “Anyone can make things bigger and more complex. What requires real effort and courage is to move in the opposite direction—in other words, to make things as simple as possible.” ——————————————— “Most people would agree that buildings represent a valuable record of any society’s past, but controversy arises when old buildings stand on ground that modern planners feel could be better used for modern purposes. In such situations, modern development should be given precedence over the preservation of historic buildings so that contemporary needs can be served.” ——————————————— “No one can possibly achieve success in the world by conforming to conventional practices and conventional ways of thinking.” ——————————————— “Students should memorize facts only after they have studied the ideas, trends, and concepts that help explain those facts. Students who have learned only facts have learned very little.” ——————————————— “Public figures such as actors, politicians, and athletes should expect people to be interested in their private lives. When they seek a public role, they should expect that they will lose at least some of their privacy.” ——————————————— “The primary goal of technological advancement should be to increase people’s efficiency so that everyone has more leisure time.” ——————————————— “Money spent on research is almost always a good investment, even when the results of that research are controversial.” ——————————————— “A school or college should pay its teachers at the same rate in all disciplines, regardless of differences in salaries for related fields in the world outside of school. For example, entry-level teachers in mathematics and in the arts should receive the same pay, even if outside of school, math specialists earn a much higher salary on average than do specialists in the arts.” ——————————————— “Creating an appealing image has become more important in contemporary society than is the reality or truth behind that image.” ——————————————— “Instead of requiring students to take courses in a variety of disciplines—that is, courses ranging from the arts and the humanities to the physical and biological sciences—colleges and universities should allow students to enroll only in those courses that will help prepare them for jobs in their chosen fields. Such concentration is necessary in today’s increasingly work-oriented society.” ——————————————— “No matter what the situation, it is more harmful to compromise one’s beliefs than to adhere to them.” ——————————————— “The greatness of individuals can be decided only by those who live after them, not by their contemporaries.” ——————————————— “In most societies, competition generally has more of a negative than a positive effect.” ——————————————— “In the age of television, reading books is not as important as it once was. People can learn as much by watching television as they can by reading books.” ——————————————— “The intellectual benefits of attending a university or college are vastly overrated: most people could learn more by studying and reading on their own for four years than by pursuing a university or college degree.” ——————————————— “Scholars and researchers should not be concerned with whether their work makes a contribution to the larger society. It is more important that they pursue their individual interests, however unusual or idiosyncratic those interests may seem.” ——————————————— “Such nonmainstream areas of inquiry as astrology, fortune-telling, and psychic and paranormal pursuits play a vital role in society by satisfying human needs that are not addressed by mainstream science.” ——————————————— “Because learning is not a solitary activity but one that requires collaboration among people, students of all ages will benefit academically if they work frequently in groups.” ——————————————— “To be an effective leader, a public official must maintain the highest ethical and moral standards.” ——————————————— “Government should not fund any scientific research whose consequences, either medical or ethical, are unclear.” ——————————————— “Government officials should rely on their own judgment rather than unquestioningly carrying out the will of the people whom they serve.” ——————————————— “While some leaders in government, sports, industry, and other areas attribute their success to a well-developed sense of competition, a society can better prepare its young people for leadership by instilling in them a sense of cooperation.” ——————————————— “Society does not place enough emphasis on the intellect—that is, on reasoning and other cognitive skills.” ——————————————— “The study of history places too much emphasis on individuals. The most significant events and trends in history were made possible not by the famous few, but by groups of people whose identities have long been forgotten.” ——————————————— “Imaginative works such as novels, plays, films, fairy tales, and legends present a more accurate and meaningful picture of human experience than do factual accounts. Because the creators of fiction shape and focus reality rather than report on it literally, their creations have a more lasting significance.” ——————————————— “In order to improve the quality of instruction at the college and university level, all faculty should be required to spend time working outside the academic world in professions relevant to the courses they teach.” ——————————————— “Education will be truly effective only when it is specifically designed to meet the individual needs and interests of each student.” ——————————————— “Education encourages students to question and criticize, and therefore does little to promote social harmony.” ——————————————— “College and university education should be free for all students, fully financed by the government.” ——————————————— “History teaches us only one thing: knowing about the past cannot help people to make important decisions today.” ——————————————— “Competition for high grades seriously limits the quality of learning at all levels of education.” ——————————————— “Governments should focus more on solving the immediate problems of today rather than trying to solve the anticipated problems of the future.” ——————————————— “The depth of knowledge to be gained from books is much richer and broader than what can be learned from direct experience.” ——————————————— “The increasingly rapid pace of life today causes more problems than it solves.” ——————————————— “Too much emphasis is placed on role models. Instead of copying others, people should learn to think and act independently and thus make the choices that are best for them.” ——————————————— “The media—and society in general—mistakenly expect an individual to speak for a particular group, whether or not that individual truly represents the views of the entire group.” ——————————————— “High-profile awards such as the Nobel Prize are actually damaging to society because they suggest that only a few people deserve such recognition.” ——————————————— “The widespread idea that people should make self-improvement a primary goal in their lives is problematic because it assumes that people are intrinsically deficient.” ——————————————— “To truly understand your own culture—no matter how you define it—requires personal knowledge of at least one other culture, one that is distinctly different from your own.” ——————————————— “Many people know how to attain success, but few know how to make the best use of it.” ——————————————— “People have been so encouraged by society to focus on apparent differences that they fail to see meaningful similarities among ideas, individuals, and groups.” ——————————————— “As people rely more and more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate.” ——————————————— “Colleges should require students to engage in public-service activities in order to assure that each student receives a balanced, well-rounded education.” ——————————————— “People make the mistake of treating experts with suspicion and mistrust, no matter how valuable their contributions might be.” ——————————————— “Government should place few, if any, restrictions on scientific research and development” ——————————————— “In any profession—business, politics, education, government—those in power should step down after five years. The surest path to success for any enterprise is revitalization through new leadership.” ——————————————— “Spending time alone makes one a better companion to others.” ——————————————— “One can best understand the most important characteristics of a society by studying its major cities.” ——————————————— “In most professions and academic fields, imagination is more important than knowledge.” ——————————————— “The most effective way to communicate an idea or value to large groups of people is through the use of images, not language.” ——————————————— “The people who make important contributions to society are generally not those who develop their own new ideas, but those who are most gifted at perceiving and coordinating the talents and skills of others.” ——————————————— “Truly profound thinkers and highly creative artists are always out of step with their time and their society.” ——————————————— “People today are too individualistic. Instead of pursuing self-centered, separate goals, people need to understand that satisfaction comes from working for the greater good of the family, the community, or society as a whole.” ——————————————— “Schools should be required to teach the essential interconnectedness of all human beings and thus help eliminate wars, cultural clashes, and other forms of conflict.” ——————————————— “Major policy decisions should always be left to politicians and other government experts, who are more informed and thus have better judgment and perspective than do members of the general public.” ——————————————— “All students should be required to take courses in the sciences, even if they have no interest in science.” ——————————————— “Patriotic reverence for the history of a nation often does more to impede than to encourage progress.” ——————————————— “Government should never censor the artistic works or historical displays that a museum wishes to exhibit.” ——————————————— “Government should preserve publicly owned wilderness areas in their natural state, even though these areas are often extremely remote and thus accessible to only a few people.” ——————————————— “In any field of endeavor, it is impossible to make a significant contribution without first being strongly influenced by past achievements within that field.” ——————————————— “Government funding of the arts threatens the integrity of the arts.” ——————————————— “Young people should be encouraged to pursue long-term, realistic goals rather than seek immediate fame and recognition.” ——————————————— “In any field of inquiry, the beginner is more likely than the expert to make important discoveries.” ——————————————— “Technologies not only influence but actually determine social customs and ethics.” ——————————————— “Leaders are created primarily by the demands that are placed upon them.” ——————————————— “College students should be encouraged to pursue subjects that interest them rather than seek programs that promise entry into the job market.” ——————————————— “Most people think that their deeply held values are the result of rational choice, but reason often has little to do with the way people form values.” ——————————————— “In any academic area or professional field, it is just as important to recognize the limits of our knowledge and understanding as it is to acquire new facts and information.” ——————————————— “The concept of ‘individual responsibility’ is a necessary fiction. Although societies must hold individuals accountable for their own actions, people’s behavior is largely determined by forces not of their own making.” ——————————————— “Universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside the student’s field of study because acquiring knowledge of various academic disciplines is the best way to become truly educated.” ——————————————— “People work more productively in teams than individually. Teamwork requires cooperation, which motivates people much more than individual competition does.” ——————————————— “Although, critics who write about the arts tend to deny the existence of any objective standards for evaluating works of art, they have a responsibility to establish standards by which works of art can be judged.” ——————————————— “It is unfortunate but true that political decisions and activities affect all aspects of people’s lives.” ——————————————— “Colleges and universities should offer more courses on popular music, film, advertising, and television because contemporary culture has much greater relevance for students than do arts and literature of the past.” ——————————————— “In any realm of life—whether academic, social, business, or political—the only way to succeed is to take a practical, rather than an idealistic, point of view. Pragmatic behavior guarantees survival, whereas idealistic views tend to be superceded by simpler, more immediate options.” ——————————————— “The pressure to achieve high grades in school seriously limits the quality of learning. An educational environment without grades would promote more genuine intellectual development.” ——————————————— “Governments should provide funding for artists so that the arts can flourish and be available to all people.” ——————————————— “For better or worse, education is a process that involves revising the ideas, beliefs, and values people held in the past.” ——————————————— “The study of history has value only to the extent that it is relevant to our daily lives.” ——————————————— “It is primarily through formal education that a culture tries to perpetuate the ideas it favors and discredit the ideas it fears.” ——————————————— “The true strength of a country is best demonstrated by the willingness of its government to tolerate challenges from its own citizens.” ——————————————— “All students should be required to take at least one course in ethics, even if taking the course means a decreased emphasis on academic subjects.” ——————————————— “Instant communication systems encourage people to form hasty opinions and give quick replies rather than take the time to develop thoughtful, well-reasoned points of view.” ——————————————— “In many countries it is now possible to turn on the television and view government at work. Watching these proceedings can help people understand the issues that affect their lives. The more kinds of government proceedings—trials, debates, meetings, etc—that are televised, the more society will benefit.” ——————————————— “The purpose of many advertisements is to make consumers want to buy a product so that they will ‘be like’ the person in the ad. This practice is effective because it not only sells products but also helps people feel better about themselves.” ——————————————— “When we concern ourselves with the study of history, we become storytellers. Because we can never know the past directly but must construct it by interpreting evidence, exploring history is more of a creative enterprise than it is an objective pursuit. All historians are storytellers.” ——————————————— “The worldwide distribution of television programs and advertisements is seriously diminishing the differences among cultures.” ——————————————— “Some educational systems emphasize the development of students’ capacity for reasoning and logical thinking, but students would benefit more from an education that also taught them to explore their own emotions.” ——————————————— “It is primarily through our identification with social groups that we define ourselves.” ——————————————— “Humanity has made little real progress over the past century or so. Technological innovations have taken place, but the overall condition of humanity is no better. War, violence, and poverty are still with us. Technology cannot change the condition of humanity.” ——————————————— “It is through the use of logic and of precise, careful measurement that we become aware of our progress. Without such tools, we have no reference points to indicate how far we have advanced or retreated.” ——————————————— “With the growth of global networks in such areas as economics and communication, there is no doubt that every aspect of society—including education, politics, the arts, and the sciences—will benefit greatly from international influences.” ——————————————— “In any field of endeavor—the sciences, the humanities, the social sciences, industry, etc.—it is not the attainment of a goal that matters, but rather the ideas and discoveries that are encountered on the way to the goal.” ——————————————— “When research priorities are being set for science, education, or any other area, the most important question to consider is: How many people’s lives will be improved if the results are successful?” ——————————————— “So much is new and complex today that looking back for an understanding of the past provides little guidance for living in the present.” ——————————————— “At various times in the geological past, many species have become extinct as a result of natural, rather than human, processes. Thus, there is no justification for society to make extraordinary efforts, especially at a great cost in money and jobs, to save endangered species.” ——————————————— “We owe almost all our knowledge not to people who have agreed, but to people who have disagreed.” ——————————————— “It is possible to identify a person’s politics within a very short time of meeting him or her. Everything about people—their clothes, their friends, the way they talk, what they eat—reflects their political beliefs.” ——————————————— “Instant foods, instant communication, faster transportation-all of these recent developments are designed to save time. Ironically, though, instead of making more leisure time available, these developments have contributed to a pace of human affairs that is more rushed and more frantic than ever before.” ——————————————— “The past is no predictor of the future.” ——————————————— “Society’s external rewards are no measure of true success. True success can be measured only in relation to the goals one sets for oneself.” ——————————————— “Facts are stubborn things. They cannot be altered by our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions.” ——————————————— “It is often asserted that the purpose of education is to free the mind and the spirit. In reality, however, formal education tends to restrain our minds and spirits rather than set them free.” ——————————————— “Technology is a necessary but not always a positive force in modern life.” ——————————————— “How children are socialized today determines the destiny of society. Unfortunately, we have not yet learned how to raise children who can help bring about a better society.” ——————————————— “The arts (painting, music, literature, etc.) reveal the otherwise hidden ideas and impulses of a society.” ——————————————— “The university community consists of three different worlds—the sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. Because each world operates on its own assumptions and has its own special habits of thinking, rarely is there meaningful interaction among the sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences.” ——————————————— “The problems of modern society have led many people to complain: ‘We live in terrible times.’ Yet, given the choice, no one today would prefer to live in any other time.” ——————————————— “Students should be encouraged to realize that mental agility and rhetorical skill must be accompanied by sincerity and the true conviction of their own beliefs.” ——————————————— “While most of the environmental problems we face result from the use of technology, society must depend upon technology to find solutions to these problems.” ——————————————— “The absence of choice is a circumstance that is very, very rare.” ——————————————— “What we call progress is a matter of exchanging one problem for another.” ——————————————— “Only through mistakes can there be discovery or progress.” ——————————————— “Every new generation needs to redefine ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ in its own terms and according to the conditions of its own time.” ——————————————— “What society has thought to be its greatest social, political, and individual achievements have often resulted in the greatest discontent.” ——————————————— “Most people recognize the benefits of individuality, but the fact is that personal economic success requires conformity.” ——————————————— “The well-being of a society is enhanced when many of its people question authority.” ——————————————— “Artists should pay little attention to their critics.* Criticism tends to undermine and constrain the artist’s creativity.” *those who evaluate works of art, such as novels, films, music, paintings, etc. ——————————————— “It is the artist, not the critic,* who gives society something of lasting value.” *a person who evaluates works of art, such as novels, films, music, paintings, etc. ——————————————— “A crucial test of character is whether one is able to adapt to changing social conventions without sacrificing one’s principles.” ——————————————— “People who are the most deeply committed to an idea or policy are the most critical of it.” ——————————————— “Tradition and modernization are incompatible. One must choose between them.” ——————————————— “Many people admire idealism, but it usually leads to disappointment or trouble.” ——————————————— “The most practical and effective way to protect wilderness areas is to attract more tourists to these areas through environmentally sensitive projects.” ——————————————— “Because of television and worldwide computer connections, people can now become familiar with a great many places that they have never visited. As a result, tourism will soon become obsolete.” ——————————————— “High-speed electronic communications media, such as electronic mail and television, tend to prevent meaningful and thoughtful communication.” ——————————————— “The only responsibility of corporate executives, provided they stay within the law, is to make as much money as possible for their companies.” ——————————————— “Students should bring a certain skepticism to whatever they study. They should question what they are taught instead of accepting it passively.” ——————————————— “Both parents and communities must be involved in the local schools. Education is too important to leave solely to a group of professional educators.” ——————————————— “Contemporary society offers so many ways of learning that reading books is no longer very important.” ——————————————— “Choice is an illusion. In reality, our lives are controlled by the society in which we live.” ——————————————— “There is no such thing as purely objective observation. All observation is subjective; it is always guided by the observer’s expectations or desires.” ——————————————— The arts (music, dance, visual arts, etc.) are vitally important to students’ education and should therefore receive as much emphasis as mathematics, science, reading and other mainstream subjects.” ——————————————— “The human mind will always be superior to machines because machines are only tools of human minds.” ——————————————— “The most essential quality of an effective leader is the ability to remain consistently committed to particular principles and objectives. Any leader who is quickly and easily influenced by shifts in popular opinion will accomplish little.” ——————————————— “In this age of intensive media coverage, it is no longer possible for a society to regard any woman or man as a hero. The reputation of anyone who is subjected to media scrutiny will eventually be diminished.” ——————————————— “One often hears about the need for individuals to take responsibility for their own lives. However, the conditions in which people find themselves have been largely established long before people become aware of them. Thus, the concept of personal responsibility is much more complicated and unrealistic than is often assumed.” ——————————————— “Most people live, whether physically or morally, in a very restricted circle. They make use of a very limited portion of the resources available to them until they face a great problem or crisis.” ——————————————— “Sometimes imagination is a more valuable asset than experience. People who lack experience are free to imagine what is possible and thus can approach a task without constraints of established habits and attitudes.” ——————————————— “In any given field, the leading voices come from people who are motivated not by conviction but by the desire to present opinions and ideas that differ from those held by the majority.” ——————————————— “Over the past century, the most significant contribution of technology has been to make people’s lives more comfortable.” ——————————————— “It is impossible for an effective political leader to tell the truth all the time. Complete honesty is not a useful virtue for a politician.” ——————————————— “Critical judgment of work in any given field has little value unless it comes from someone who is an expert in that field.” ——————————————— “Those who treat politics and morality as though they were separate realms fail to understand either the one or the other.” ——————————————— “The surest indicator of a great nation is not the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists, but the general welfare of all its people.” ——————————————— “People who pursue their own intellectual interests for purely personal reasons are more likely to benefit the rest of the world than are people who try to act for the public good.”"},{"title":"英语单词记忆工具","date":"2024-10-16T15:21:06.332Z","updated":"2024-10-16T15:21:06.332Z","comments":true,"path":"eng/index.html","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/eng/index.html","excerpt":"","text":"// 在页面加载时，检查用户是否已通过身份验证 window.onload = function() { fetch('/protected', { credentials: 'include' }) .then(response => { if (response.ok) { // 用户已认证，显示内容 document.getElementById(\"protected-content\").style.display = \"block\"; } else { // 用户未认证，重定向到登录页面 window.location.href = '/login'; // 重定向到 Auth0 登录页面 } }); }; window.location.href = \"https://www.appsheet.com/start/0d849008-4c3f-4ff5-bbb6-aa347ddf3850\"; If you are not redirected automatically, click here.

When you take the test, you will be presented with one Argument topic from this pool. The wording of some topics in the test might vary slightly from what is presented here. Therefore, read your test topic carefully and respond to the wording as it appears in the actual test. Discuss how well reasoned you find this argument. A recent study shows that people living on the continent of North America suffer 9 times more chronic fatigue and 31 times more chronic depression than do people living on the continent of Asia. Interestingly, Asians, on average, eat 20 grams of soy per day, whereas North Americans eat virtually none. It turns out that soy contains phytochemicals called isoflavones, which have been found to possess disease–preventing properties. Thus, North Americans should consider eating soy on a regular basis as a way of preventing fatigue and depression. ——————————————— The following is taken from the editorial section of the local newspaper in Rockingham. “In order to save a considerable amount of money, Rockingham’s century-old town hall should be torn down and replaced by the larger and more energy-efficient building that some citizens have proposed. The old town hall is too small to comfortably accommodate the number of people who are employed by the town. In addition, it is very costly to heat the old hall in winter and cool it in summer. The new, larger building would be more energy efficient, costing less per square foot to heat and cool than the old hall. Furthermore, it would be possible to rent out some of the space in the new building, thereby generating income for the town of Rockingham.” ——————————————— Claitown University needs both affordable housing for its students and a way to fund the building of such housing. The best solution to this problem is to commission a famous architect known for experimental and futuristic buildings. It is common knowledge that tourists are willing to pay money to tour some of the architect’s buildings, so it can be expected that tourists will want to visit this new building. The income from the fees charged to tourists will soon cover the building costs. Furthermore, such a building will attract new students as well as donations from alumni. And even though such a building will be much larger than our current need for student housing, part of the building can be used as office space. ——————————————— The following appeared in a business magazine. “As a result of numerous consumer complaints of dizziness and nausea, Promofoods requested that eight million cans of tuna be returned for testing last year. Promofoods concluded that the cans did not, after all, contain chemicals that posed a health risk. This conclusion is based on the fact that the chemists from Promofoods tested samples of the recalled cans and found that, of the eight chemicals most commonly blamed for causing symptoms of dizziness and nausea, five were not found in any of the tested cans. The chemists did find that the three remaining suspected chemicals are naturally found in all other kinds of canned foods.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a local newspaper. “People should not be misled by the advertising competition between Coldex and Cold-Away, both popular over-the-counter cold medications that anyone can purchase without a doctor’s prescription. Each brand is accusing the other of causing some well-known, unwanted side effect: Coldex is known to contribute to existing high blood pressure and Cold-Away is known to cause drowsiness. But the choice should be clear for most health-conscious people: Cold-Away has been on the market for much longer and is used by more hospitals than is Coldex. Clearly, Cold-Away is more effective.” ——————————————— A folk remedy* for insomnia, the scent in lavender flowers, has now been proved effective. In a recent study, 30 volunteers with chronic insomnia slept each night for three weeks on lavender-scented pillows in a controlled room where their sleep was monitored. During the first week, volunteers continued to take their usual sleeping medication. They slept soundly but wakened feeling tired. During the second week, the volunteers discontinued their medication. As a result, they slept less soundly than the previous week and felt even more tired. During the third week, the volunteers slept longer and more soundly than in the previous two weeks. This shows that over a short period of time lavender cures insomnia. *A folk remedy is usually a plant-based form of treatment common to traditional forms of medicine, ones that developed before the advent of modern medical services and technology. ——————————————— Typically, as people age, their bone mass decreases, making them more vulnerable to bone fractures. A recent study concludes that the most effective way to reduce the risk of fractures in later life is to take twice the recommended dose of vitamin D and calcium daily. The three-year study followed a group of French women in their eighties who were nursing-home residents. The women were given daily supplements of twice the recommended dose of vitamin D and calcium. In addition, the women participated in a light weightlifting program. After three years, these women showed a much lower rate of hip fractures than is average for their age. ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter from a department chairperson to the president of Pierce University. “Some studies conducted by Bronston College, which is also located in a small town, reveal that both male and female professors are happier living in small towns when their spouses are also employed in the same geographic area. Therefore, in the interest of attracting the most gifted teachers and researchers to our faculty and improving the morale of our entire staff, we at Pierce University should offer employment to the spouse of each new faculty member we hire. Although we cannot expect all offers to be accepted or to be viewed as an ideal job offer, the money invested in this effort will clearly be well spent because, if their spouses have a chance of employment, new professors will be more likely to accept our offers.” ——————————————— For the past five years, consumers in California have been willing to pay twice as much for oysters from the northeastern Atlantic Coast as for Gulf Coast oysters. This trend began shortly after harmful bacteria were found in a few raw Gulf Coast oysters. But scientists have now devised a process for killing the bacteria. Once consumers are made aware of the increased safety of Gulf Coast oysters, they are likely to be willing to pay as much for Gulf Coast as for northeastern Atlantic Coast oysters, and greater profits for Gulf Coast oyster producers will follow. ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the marketing director of Bargain Brand Cereals. “One year ago we introduced our first product, ‘Bargain Brand’ breakfast cereal. Our very low prices quickly drew many customers away from the top-selling cereal companies. Although the companies producing the top brands have since tried to compete with us by lowering their prices, and although several plan to introduce their own budget brands, not once have we needed to raise our prices to continue making a profit. Given our success selling cereal, Bargain Brand should now expand its business and begin marketing other low-priced food products as quickly as possible.” ——————————————— The Mozart School of Music should obviously be the first choice of any music student aware of its reputation. First of all, the Mozart School stresses intensive practice and training, so that students typically begin their training at a very young age. Second, the school has ample facilities and up-to-date professional equipment, and its faculty includes some of the most distinguished music teachers in the world. Finally, many Mozart graduates have gone on to be the best known and most highly paid musicians in the nation. ——————————————— The following is a memorandum issued by the publisher of a newsmagazine, Newsbeat, in the country of Dinn. “Our poorest-selling magazine issues over the past three years were those that featured international news stories on their front covers. Over the same period, competing news-magazines have significantly decreased the number of cover stories that they devote to international news. Moreover, the cost of maintaining our foreign bureaus to report on international news is increasing. Therefore, we should decrease our emphasis on international news and refrain from displaying such stories on our magazine covers.” ——————————————— The following recommendation was made by the president and administrative staff of Grove College, a private institution, to the college’s governing committee. “We recommend that Grove College preserve its century-old tradition of all-female education rather than admit men into its programs. It is true that a majority of faculty members voted in favor of coeducation, arguing that it would encourage more students to apply to Grove. But eighty percent of the students responding to a survey conducted by the student government wanted the school to remain all female, and over half of the alumni who answered a separate survey also opposed coeducation. Keeping the college all-female, therefore, will improve morale among students and convince alumni to keep supporting the college financially.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter to the school board in the town of Centerville. “All students should be required to take the driver’s education course at Centerville High School. In the past two years several accidents in and around Centerville have involved teenage drivers. Since a number of parents in Centerville have complained that they are too busy to teach their teenagers to drive, some other instruction is necessary to ensure that these teenagers are safe drivers. Although there are two driving schools in Centerville, parents on a tight budget cannot afford to pay for driving instruction. Therefore an effective and mandatory program sponsored by the high school is the only solution to this serious problem.” ——————————————— The following is a memorandum from the sales director to the president of the Healthy-and-Good food company. “A recent study indicates that Venadial, a new margarine currently produced only in the country of Alta, actually reduces cholesterol levels. Derived from the resin of pine trees, Venadial works by activating a metabolic response that is not yet well understood. However, cholesterol levels fell ten to fifteen percent among participants in the study who consumed Venadial daily, and the risk of heart attack by one-third. In addition, the new margarine is so popular that stores in Alta are unable to keep it on their shelves. Therefore, if our company obtains the exclusive right to sell Venadial internationally, our profits are sure to increase substantially within a very short time.” ——————————————— The following is a letter that recently appeared in the Oak City Gazette, a local newspaper. “Membership in Oak City’s Civic Club — a club whose primary objective is to discuss local issues — should continue to be restricted to people who live in Oak City. People who work in Oak City but who live elsewhere cannot truly understand the business and politics of the city. It is important to restrict membership to city residents because only residents pay city taxes and therefore only residents understand how the money could best be used to improve the city. At any rate, restricting membership in this way is unlikely to disappoint many of the nonresidents employed in Oak City, since neighboring Elm City’s Civic Club has always had an open membership policy, and only twenty-five nonresidents have joined Elm City’s Club in the last ten years.” ——————————————— The following appeared in the annual report from the president of the National Brush Company. “In order to save money, we at the National Brush Company have decided to pay our employees for each brush they produce instead of for the time they spend producing brushes. We believe that this policy will lead to the production of more and better brushes, will allow us to reduce our staff size, and will enable the company factories to operate for fewer hours — resulting in savings on electricity and security costs. These changes will ensure that the best workers keep their jobs and that the company will earn a profit in the coming year.” ——————————————— The following is a memorandum written by the director of personnel to the president of the Cedar Corporation. “It would be a mistake to rehire the Good-Taste Company to supply the food in our employee cafeteria next year. It is the second most expensive caterer in the city. In addition, its prices have risen in each of the last three years, and it refuses to provide meals for people on special diets. Just last month three employees complained to me that they no longer eat in the cafeteria because they find the experience ‘unbearable.’ Our company should instead hire Discount Foods. Discount is a family-owned local company and it offers a varied menu of fish and poultry. I recently tasted a sample lunch at one of the many companies that Discount serves and it was delicious — an indication that hiring Discount will lead to improved employee satisfaction.” ——————————————— The following is a recommendation from the personnel director to the president of Acme Publishing Company. “Many other companies have recently stated that having their employees take the Easy Read Speed-Reading Course has greatly improved productivity. One graduate of the course was able to read a five-hundred-page report in only two hours; another graduate rose from an assistant manager to vice president of the company in under a year. Obviously, the faster you can read, the more information you can absorb in a single workday. Moreover, Easy Read costs only $500 per employee — a small price to pay when you consider the benefits to Acme. Included in this fee is a three-week seminar in Spruce City and a lifelong subscription to the Easy Read newsletter. Clearly, Acme would benefit greatly by requiring all of our employees to take the Easy Read course.” ——————————————— From a letter to the editor of a city newspaper. “One recent research study has indicated that many adolescents need more sleep than they are getting, and another study has shown that many high school students in our city are actually dissatisfied with their own academic performance. As a way of combating these problems, the high schools in our city should begin classes at 8:30 A.M. instead of 7:30 A.M., and end the school day an hour later. This arrangement will give students an extra hour of sleep in the morning, thereby making them more alert and more productive. Consequently, the students will perform better on tests and other assignments, and their academic skills will improve significantly.” ——————————————— Butter has now been replaced by margarine in Happy Pancake House restaurants throughout the southwestern United States. Only about 2 percent of customers have complained, indicating that 98 people out of 100 are happy with the change. Furthermore, many servers have reported that a number of customers who still ask for butter do not complain when they are given margarine instead. Clearly, either these customers cannot distinguish margarine from butter, or they use the term ‘butter’ to refer to either butter or margarine. Thus, to avoid the expense of purchasing butter, the Happy Pancake House should extend this cost-saving change to its restaurants in the southeast and northeast as well. ——————————————— Many employees of major United States corporations are fearful that they will lose their jobs in the near future, but this fear is largely unfounded. According to a recent study, a majority of companies expected to make new hires in the coming year, while fewer companies expected to lay off employees. In addition, although it is very disturbing to be laid off, the proliferation of programs and of workshops designed to improve job-finding skills has made being laid off far less painful than it once was. ——————————————— In the Bayhead Public Library, books that are rarely borrowed continue to take up shelf space year after year, while people who want to read a recent novel frequently find that the library’s only copy is checked out. Clearly, the library’s plan to replace books that are borrowed no more than once a year with sufficient copies of more recent books will solve this problem. The protest we have heard since this plan was made public has come from a small, and thus unrepresentative, group of some thirty people and so should therefore be ignored. ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter from the owner of the Sunnyside Towers apartment building to its manager. “One month ago, all the showerheads on the first five floors of SunnysideT owers were modified to restrict the water flow to approximately 1&#x2F;3 of its original force. Although actual readings of water usage before and after the adjustment are not yet available, the change will obviously result in a considerable savings for Sunnyside Corporation, since the corporation must pay for water each month. Except for a few complaints about low water pressure, no problems with showers have been reported since the adjustment. Clearly, restricting water flow throughout all the 20 floors of Sunnyside Towers will increase our profits further.” ——————————————— The following is a recommendation from the director of personnel to the president of Professional Printing Company. “In a recent telephone survey of automobile factory workers, older employees were less likely to report that having a supervisor present increases their productivity. Among workers aged 18 to 29, 27 percent said that they are more productive in the presence of their immediate supervisor, compared to 12 percent for those aged 30 or over, and only 8 percent for those aged 50 or over. Clearly, if our printing company hires mainly older employees, we will increase productivity and save money because of the reduced need for supervisors. “ ——————————————— The following appeared as part of an article in a health magazine. “A new discovery warrants a drastic change in the diets of people living in the United States. Two scientists have recently suggested that omega -3 fatty acids (found in some fish and fish oils) play a key role in mental health. Our ancestors, who ate less saturated fat and more polyunsaturated fat, including omega -3 fatty acids, were much less likely to suffer from depression than we are today. Moreover, modern societies — such as those in Japan and Taiwan — that consume large quantities of fish report depression rates lower than that in the United States. Given this link between omega -3 fatty acids and depression, it is important for all people in the United States to increase their consumption of fish in order to prevent depression.” ——————————————— A new report suggests that men and women experience pain very differently from one another, and that doctors should consider these differences when prescribing pain medications. When researchers administered the same dosage of kappa opioids — a painkiller — to 28 men and 20 women who were having their wisdom teeth extracted, the women reported feeling much less pain than the men, and the easing of pain lasted considerably longer in women. This research suggests that kappa opioids should be prescribed for women whenever pain medication is required, whereas men should be given other kinds of pain medication. In addition, researchers should reevaluate the effects of all medications on men versus women. ——————————————— The following is a recommendation from the dean at Foley College, a small liberal arts college, to the president of the college. “Since college-bound students are increasingly concerned about job prospects after graduation, Foley College should attempt to increase enrollment by promising to find its students jobs after they graduate. Many administrators feel that this strategy is a way for Foley to compete against larger and more prestigious schools and to encourage students to begin preparing for careers as soon as they enter college. Furthermore, a student who must choose a career path within his or her first year of college and who is guaranteed a job after graduation is more likely to successfully complete the coursework that will prepare him or her for the future.” ——————————————— The following is a letter to the editor of the Glenville Gazette, a local newspaper. “Over the past few years, the number of people who have purchased advance tickets for the Glenville Summer Concert series has declined, indicating lack of community support. Although the weather has been unpredictable in the past few years, this cannot be the reason for the decline in advance ticket purchases, because many people attended the concerts even in bad weather. Clearly, then, the reason for the decline is the choice of music, so the organizers of the concert should feature more modern music in the future and should be sure to include music composed by Richerts, whose recordings Glenville residents purchase more often than any other contemporary recordings. This strategy will undoubtedly increase advance ticket purchases and will increase attendance at the concerts.” ——————————————— The following is a letter from a professor at Xanadu College to the college’s president. “The development of an extensive computer-based long-distance learning program will enhance the reputation of Xanadu College. This program would allow more students to enroll in our courses, thereby increasing our income from student tuition. Traditional courses could easily be adapted for distance learners, as was shown by the adaptation of two traditional courses for our distance learning trial project last year. Also, by using computer programs and taped lectures, faculty will have fewer classroom obligations and more time to engage in extensive research, thereby enhancing the reputation of Xanadu.” ——————————————— The following is a letter to the editor of the Roseville Gazette. “Despite opposition from some residents of West Roseville, the arguments in favor of merging the townships of Roseville and West Roseville are overwhelming. First, residents in both townships are confused about which authority to contact when they need a service; for example, the police department in Roseville receives many calls from residents of West Roseville. This sort of confusion would be eliminated with the merger. Second, the savings in administrative costs would be enormous, since services would no longer be duplicated: we would have only one fire chief, one tax department, one mayor, and so on. And no jobs in city government would be lost — employees could simply be reassigned. Most importantly, the merger will undoubtedly attract business investments as it did when the townships of Hamden and North Hamden merged ten years ago.” ——————————————— The Department of Education in the state of Attra recommends that high school students be assigned homework every day. Yet a recent statewide survey of high school math and science teachers calls the usefulness of daily homework into question. In the district of Sanlee, 86 percent of the teachers reported assigning homework three to five times a week, whereas in the district of Marlee, less than 25 percent of the teachers reported assigning homework three to five times a week. Yet the students in Marlee earn better grades overall and are less likely to be required to repeat a year of school than are the students in Sanlee. Therefore, all teachers in our high schools should assign homework no more than twice a week, if at all. ——————————————— A recent study suggests that people who are left-handed are more likely to succeed in business than are right-handed people. Researchers studied photographs of 1,000 prominent business executives and found that 21 percent of these executives wrote with their left hand. So the percentage of prominent business executives who are left-handed (21 percent) is almost twice the percentage of people in the general population who are left-handed (11 percent). Thus, people who are left-handed would be well advised to pursue a career in business, whereas people who are right-handed would be well advised to imitate the business practices exhibited by left-handers. ——————————————— The following is a letter from an editor at Liber Publishing Company to the company’s president. “In recent years, Liber has unfortunately moved away from its original mission: to publish the works of regional small-town authors instead of those of big-city authors. Just last year, 90 percent of the novels we published were written by authors who maintain a residence in a big city. Although this change must have been intended to increase profits, it has obviously backfired, because Liber is now in serious financial trouble. The only way to address this problem is to return to our original mission. If we return to publishing only the works of regional small-town authors, our financial troubles will soon be resolved.” ——————————————— Sadly, widespread negative images of businesspeople have been created in large part by television. Consider the fact that, although they make up a mere 10 percent of the characters in dramatic roles on television, businesspeople are responsible for about one-fifth of all the crime on television shows. In fact, in a recent survey of television producers, only 35 percent of the television roles for businesspeople were viewed as positive ones. ——————————————— The following appeared as part of a recommendation made by a faculty member to the president of a large university. “Never once in our 150-year history as a university have we clarified our objectives. How, then, can we hope to adapt as an institution to the new challenges facing higher education. As a first step in this evolutionary process, therefore, we should send out questionnaires asking faculty members why they teach, asking students what they want from this university, and asking former students what they gained from their own education here. When the replies come in, we can tabulate them and formulate an official statement of our educational mission. This will surely result in improved programs at our university.” ——————————————— There is a general idea that a translation always fails to preserve some of the qualities that distinguish the original work — i.e., that ‘something always gets lost in translation.’ Writers, critics, and the general reading public unthinkingly accept this clichè. But this belief is unwarranted: translators are sometimes distinguished authors themselves, and some authors may even translate their own works. As the translator pointed out in the preface to an English version of Dante’s works, the violin and the piano make different sounds, but they can play what is recognizably the same piece of music. ——————————————— There is a general idea that waiters and waitresses are more likely to receive larger gratuities from large groups of people. A recent research study suggests this is not true. The researchers examined the relationship between the size of tips in restaurants and the number of meals charged on the bill. They found that, while most tips were around 15 percent, the minimum percentage considered appropriate, people dining alone tipped consistently more (19 percent) and those dining in groups of four or more tipped considerably less (13 percent) than this 15 percent standard. These results strongly suggest that people dining in a group are less likely to feel personally responsible for leaving an adequate or generous tip. ——————————————— Statistics collected from dentists indicate that three times more men than women faint while visiting the dentist. This evidence suggests that men are more likely to be distressed about having dental work done than women are. Thus, dentists who advertise to attract patients should target the male consumer and emphasize both the effectiveness of their anesthetic techniques and the sensitivity of their staff to nervous or suffering patients. ——————————————— The citizens of Forsythe have adopted healthier lifestyles. Their responses to a recent survey show that in their eating habits they conform more closely to government nutritional recommendations than they did ten years ago. Furthermore, there has been a fourfold increase in sales of food products containing kiran, a substance that a scientific study has shown reduces cholesterol. This trend is also evident in reduced sales of sulia, a food that few of the healthiest citizens regularly eat. ——————————————— Humans arrived in the Kaliko Islands about 7,000 years ago, and within 3,000 years most of the large mammal species that had lived in the forests of the Kaliko Islands had become extinct. Yet humans cannot have been a factor in the species’ extinctions, because there is no evidence that the humans had any significant contact with the mammals. Further, archaeologists have discovered numerous sites where the bones of fish had been discarded, but they found no such areas containing the bones of large mammals, so the humans cannot have hunted the mammals. Therefore, some climate change or other environmental factor must have caused the species’ extinctions. ——————————————— The following appeared in a newspaper feature story. “At the small, nonprofit hospital in the town of Saluda, the average length of a patient’s stay is two days; at the large, for-profit hospital in the nearby city of Megaville, the average patient stay is six days. Also, the cure rate among patients in the Saluda hospital is about twice that of the Megaville hospital. The Saluda hospital has more employees per patient than the hospital in Megaville, and there are few complaints about service at the local hospital. Such data indicate that treatment in smaller, nonprofit hospitals is more economical and of better quality than treatment in larger, for-profit hospitals.” ——————————————- The following appeared as a letter to the editor of a farming publication. “With continuing publicity about the need for healthful diets, and with new research about the harmful effects of eating too much sugar, nationwide demand for sugar will no doubt decline. Therefore, farmers in our state should use the land on which they currently grow sugar cane to grow peanuts, a food that is rich in protein and low in sugar. Farmers in the neighboring country of Palin greatly increased their production of peanuts last year, and their total revenues from that crop were quite high.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a recommendation from the president of Amburg’s Chamber of Commerce. “Last October the city of Belleville installed high intensity lighting in its central business district, and vandalism there declined almost immediately. The city of Amburg has recently begun police patrols on bicycles in its business district but the rate of vandalism there remains constant. Since high intensity lighting is apparently the most effective way to combat crime, we should install such lighting throughout Amburg. By reducing crime in this way, we can revitalize the declining neighborhoods in our city.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter to the editor of the Parkville Daily Newspaper. “Throughout the country last year, as more and more children below the age of nine participated in youth-league softball and soccer, over 80,000 of these young players suffered injuries. When interviewed for a recent study, youth-league softball players in several major cities also reported psychological pressure from coaches and parents to win games. Furthermore, education experts say that long practice sessions for these sports take away time that could be used for academic activities. Since the disadvantages apparently outweigh any advantages, we in Parkville should discontinue organized athletic competition for children under nine.” ——————————————— It is known that in recent years, industrial pollution has caused the Earth’s ozone layer to thin, allowing an increase in the amount of ultraviolet radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface. At the same time, scientists have discovered, the population of a species of salamander that lays its eggs in mountain lakes has declined. Since ultraviolet radiation is known to be damaging to delicate tissues and since salamander eggs have no protective shells, it must be the case that the increase in ultraviolet radiation has damaged many salamander eggs and prevented them from hatching. This process will no doubt cause population declines in other species, just as it has in the salamander species. ——————————————— The following appeared in a memorandum from the planning department of an electric power company. “Several recent surveys indicate that homeowners are increasingly eager to conserve energy and manufacturers are now marketing many home appliances, such as refrigerators and air conditioners, that are almost twice as energy-efficient as those sold a decade ago. Also, new technologies for better home insulation and passive solar heating are readily available to reduce the energy needed for home heating. Therefore, we anticipate that the total demand for electricity in our area will not increase, and may decline slightly. Since our three electric generating plants in operation for the past 20 years have always met our needs, construction of new generating plants should not be necessary.” ——————————————— The following recommendation was made by the Human Resources Manager to the board of directors of the Fancy Toy Company. “In the last three quarters of this year, under the leadership of our president, Pat Salvo, our profits have fallen considerably. Thus, we should ask for her resignation in return for a generous severance package. In Pat’s place, we should appoint Rosa Winnings. Rosa is currently president of Starlight Jewelry, a company whose profits have increased dramatically over the past several years. Although we will have to pay Rosa twice the salary that Pat has been receiving, it will be well worth it because we can soon expect our profits to increase considerably.” ——————————————— The following is a letter to the editor of a news magazine. “Clearly, the successful use of robots on missions to explore outer space in the past 20 years demonstrates that robots could be increasingly used to perform factory work more effectively, efficiently, and profitably than human factory workers. The use of robots in factories would offer several advantages. First, robots never get sick, so absenteeism would be reduced. Second, robots do not make mistakes, so factories would increase their output. Finally, the use of robots would also improve the morale of factory workers, since factory work can be so boring that many workers would be glad to shift to more interesting kinds of tasks.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memorandum to faculty from the academic vice president of Waymarsh University. “So that we can better accomplish Waymarsh University’s academic goals, we should adopt the job-opportunity (job-op) program offered at Plateau Technical College and strongly encourage all students at Waymarsh to participate in it. The success of the job-op program at Plateau is evident: Over the past two years, more than 75% of the freshmen at Plateau have enrolled in the optional job-op program. Moreover, at Plateau, the grades of job-op students are consistently higher than those of other students, 90% of the job-op students receive job offers within a month after their graduation, and most former job-op students report much success in their careers.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memorandum from the new president of the Patriot car manufacturing company. “In the past, the body styles of Patriot cars have been old-fashioned, and our cars have not sold as well as have our competitors’ cars. But now, since many regions in this country report rapid increases in the numbers of newly licensed drivers, we should be able to increase our share of the market by selling cars to this growing population. Thus, we should discontinue our oldest models and concentrate instead on manufacturing sporty cars. We can also improve the success of our marketing campaigns by switching our advertising to the Youth Advertising agency, which has successfully promoted the country’s leading soft drink.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memorandum from the owner of Armchair Video, a chain of video rental stores. “Because of declining profits, we must reduce operating expenses at Armchair Video’s ten video rental stores. Raising prices is not a good option, since we are famous for our special bargains. Instead, we should reduce our operating hours. Last month our store in downtown Marston reduced its hours by closing at 6:00 P.M. rather than 9:00 P.M. and reduced its overall inventory by no longer stocking any film released more than two years ago. Since we have received very few customer complaints about these new policies, we should now adopt them at all other Armchair Video stores as our best strategies for improving profits.” ——————————————— In each city in the region of Treehaven, the majority of the money spent on government-run public school education comes from taxes that each city government collects. The region’s cities differ, however, in the value they place on public education. For example, Parson City typically budgets twice as much money per year as Blue City does for its public schools — even though both cities have about the same number of residents. It seems clear, therefore, that Parson City residents care more about public school education than do Blue City residents. ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter to the Grandview City Council from a local business leader. “During last year’s severe drought, when the water supply in the Grandview city reservoir fell to an extremely low level, the city council imposed much more rigid water-rationing rules. But just after these rules were imposed, industrial growth in the area declined. This clearly shows that the new rationing rules have hurt industry in Grandview. Therefore, to promote the health of the local economy, the city council should now stop water rationing.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a magazine article about planning for retirement. “Because of its spectacular natural beauty and consistent climate, Clearview should be a top choice for anyone seeking a place to retire. As a bonus, housing costs in Clearview have fallen significantly during the past year, and real estate taxes remain lower than those in neighboring towns. Nevertheless, Clearview’s mayor promises many new programs to improve schools, streets, and public services. Retirees in Clearview can also expect excellent health care as they grow older, since the number of physicians in the area is far greater than the national average.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a brochure promoting the purchase of local franchises for a national chain of gyms. “Now is the time to invest in a Power-Lift Gym franchise so that you can profit from opening one of our gyms in your town. Consider the current trends: Power-Lift Gyms are already popular among customers in 500 locations, and national surveys indicate increasing concern with weight loss and physical fitness. Furthermore, last year’s sales of books and magazines on personal health totaled more than $50 million, and purchases of home exercise equipment almost doubled. Investing now in a Power-Lift Gym franchise will guarantee a quick profit.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memorandum from the president of Hyper-Go Toy Company. “Last year, sales of our Fierce Fighter toy airplane declined sharply, even though the toy had been a top seller for three years. Our customer surveys show that parents are now more worried about youthful violence and are concerned about better education for their children. Therefore, to maintain profits we should discontinue all our action toys and focus exclusively on a new line of educational toys. Several other toy companies have already begun marketing educational toys and report sales increases last year of 200 percent. And since the average family income is growing, sales of new Hyper-Go toys should also increase.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memorandum from a vice president of the Megamart department store chain. “For the third year in a row, the average household income in our country has risen significantly. That prosperity means that families are likely to be spending more time and money on leisure activities. Megamart stores should therefore concentrate on enlarging and promoting its line of products typically used in leisure activities: athletic and outdoor equipment, televisions, gourmet cooking equipment, and luggage and travel accessories.” ——————————————— The following appeared in an article in a magazine for writers. “A recent study showed that in describing a typical day’s conversation, people make an average of 23 references to watching television and only 1 reference to reading fiction. This result suggests that, compared with the television industry, the publishing and bookselling industries are likely to decline in profitability. Therefore, people who wish to have careers as writers should acquire training and experience in writing for television rather than for print media.” ——————————————— The following appeared in the editorial section of a student newspaper. “In a recent survey, most students who were studying beginning Russian gave higher course-evaluation ratings to classes taught by non-native Russian speakers than to classes taught by native Russian speakers. The reason that the non-native speakers were better teachers of Russian is easy to see: the non-native speakers learned Russian later in life themselves, and so they have a better understanding of how the language can be taught effectively. Therefore, in order to improve instruction for all languages and also save money, our university should hire non-native speakers as language instructors instead of trying to find and recruit native speakers.” ——————————————— The following article appeared in a recent issue of a college newspaper. “Among all students who graduated from Hooper University over the past five years, more physical science majors than social science majors found permanent jobs within a year of graduation. In a survey of recent Hooper University graduates, most physical science majors said they believed that the prestige of Hooper University’s physical science programs helped them significantly in finding a job. In contrast, social science majors who found permanent employment attributed their success to their own personal initiative. Therefore, to ensure that social science majors find permanent jobs, Hooper University should offer additional social science courses and hire several new faculty members who already have national reputations in the social sciences.” ——————————————— The following appeared as an editorial in one of Coleville’s city newspapers. “Even though a high percentage of Coleville City’s businesses failed last year, we who live in Coleville City should keep in mind the fact that the Coleville region has attracted a great many new businesses over the last three years. It is well known that new businesses are, on average, much more likely to fail than are long-established ones, so the business failures should not be considered a sign of poor economic health. Indeed, many analysts regard the presence of a significant number of new companies among a region’s businesses as a sign of economic health. Thus Coleville City appears to be in good, not poor, economic shape.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a corporate planning memo at ABC Cereal Company, the makers of Better Bran cereal. “Sales of Better Bran have declined in recent years, for reasons that management has now identified. First, Better Bran is a cereal with high sugar content, and recent research studies have found that most consumers say they are concerned about the amount of sugar added to their breakfast cereal. Second, the price of Better Bran has increased by 5 percent in each of the last three years. Therefore, to increase our company’s profits we need to reduce the amount of sugar in Better Bran and lower Better Bran’s price.” ——————————————— The following appeared as part of a letter to the editor of a local newspaper. “During her three years in office, Governor Riedeburg has shown herself to be a worthy leader. Since she took office, crime has decreased, the number of jobs created per year has doubled, and the number of people choosing to live in our state has increased. These trends are likely to continue if she is reelected. In addition, Ms. Riedeburg has promised to take steps to keep big companies here, thereby providing jobs for any new residents. Anyone who looks at Ms. Riedeburg’s record can tell that she is the best-qualified candidate for governor.” ——————————————— The following appeared as part of a memo from the manager of an automobile manufacturing company. “Because the demand for our automobiles is expected to increase dramatically, we need to open a new manufacturing plant as soon as possible in order to continue to thrive. Our marketing projections indicate that 80 million people will want to buy our automobiles, yet our existing plant can only produce 40 million automobiles. The new plant can be opened on a part-time basis, with workers from our existing site rotating responsibilities, until an operational staff can be trained. A major airplane manufacturer was extremely successful using this part-time rotating strategy when it opened its new plant five years ago.” ——————————————— The following appeared as an editorial in a local newspaper. “In order to attract visitors to Central Plaza downtown and to return the plaza to its former glory, the city should prohibit skateboarding there and instead allow skateboarders to use an area in Monroe Park. At Central Plaza, skateboard users are about the only people one sees now, and litter and defaced property have made the plaza unattractive. In a recent survey of downtown merchants, the majority supported a prohibition on skateboarding in the plaza. Clearly, banning skateboarding in Central Plaza will make the area a place where people can congregate for fun or for relaxation.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a newsletter from a political organization. “In order to promote economic growth in the city, city residents should vote ‘yes’ on the state government’s proposal to build a new expressway linking the outlying suburbs directly to the city center. A direct link to the city center will enable downtown businesses to receive deliveries more frequently, so that downtown retailers will no longer run out of stock and city manufacturers will not be affected by shortages of materials. Booming businesses will attract qualified workers from all over the state, workers who will be able to take advantage of the new expressway to commute to work in our city. In addition to these advantages, hundreds of workers will be employed to build the expressway, further stimulating the local economy!” ——————————————— The following appeared as part of a memo from the manager of a hazardous-waste disposal company. “Our new plan will help us better protect our staff against exposure to toxic chemicals: We are fitting each new safety suit with an alarm that will sound in the main control booth when the suit is punctured. The control booth will notify the managers on duty, who will then take the necessary steps to ensure employees’ safety. In addition to the obvious safety-related benefits, the fast reaction time will ensure minimal work stoppage and thus result in increased worker productivity and company profitability.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a recommendation from the planning department of the city of Transopolis. “Ten years ago, as part of a comprehensive urban renewal program, the city of Transopolis adapted for industrial use a large area of severely substandard housing near the freeway. Subsequently, several factories were constructed there, crime rates in the area declined, and property tax revenues for the entire city increased. To further revitalize the city, we should now take similar action in a declining residential area on the opposite side of the city. Since some houses and apartments in existing nearby neighborhoods are currently unoccupied, alternate housing for those displaced by this action will be readily available.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter to the editor of a local newspaper. “The members of the town school board should not be reelected because they are not concerned about promoting high-quality education in the arts in our local schools. For example, student participation in the high school drama club has been declining steadily, and this year the school board refused to renew the contract of the drama director, even though he had received many awards for his original plays. Meanwhile, over $300,000 of the high school budget goes to athletic programs, and the head football coach is now the highest-paid member of the teaching staff.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the sales manager of Eco-Power, a company that manufactures tools and home appliances. “Many popular radio and television commercials use memorable tunes and song lyrics to call attention to the products being advertised. Indeed, a recent study of high school students showed that 85 percent could easily recognize the tunes used to advertise leading soft drinks and fast-food restaurants. Despite our company’s extensive advertising in magazines during the past year, sales of our home appliances declined. Therefore, to boost company profits, we should now switch to advertisements featuring a distinctive song.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the vice president of a company that builds shopping malls throughout the country. “The surface of a section of Route 101, paved two years ago by McAdam Road Builders, is now badly cracked and marred by dangerous potholes. In another part of the state, a section of Route 66, paved by Appian Roadways more than four years ago, is still in good condition. Appian Roadways has recently purchased state-of-the-art paving machinery, and it has hired a new quality-control manager. Because of its superior work and commitment to quality, we should contract with Appian Roadways rather than McAdam Road Builders to construct the access roads for all our new shopping malls.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a newspaper feature story. “There is now evidence that the relaxed manner of living in small towns promotes better health and greater longevity than does the hectic pace of life in big cities. Businesses in the small town of Leeville report fewer days of sick leave taken by individual workers than do businesses in the nearby large city of Mason City. Furthermore, Leeville has only one physician for its one thousand residents, but in Mason City the proportion of physicians to residents is five times as high. And the average age of Leeville residents is significantly higher than that of Mason City residents. These findings suggest that people seeking longer and healthier lives should consider moving to small communities.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memorandum from the general manager of KNOW radio station. “Several factors indicate that radio station KNOW should shift its programming from rock-and-roll music to a continuous news format. Consider, for example, the number of older people in our listening area has increased dramatically, while the total number of our listeners has recently declined. Also, music stores in our area report decreased sales of recorded music. Finally, continuous news stations in neighboring cities have been very successful, and a survey taken just before the recent election shows that local citizens are interested in becoming better informed about politics.” ——————————————— The following appeared as a letter to the editor of a local Solano newspaper. “The Solano school district should do away with its music education programs. After all, music programs are not especially popular in our schools: Only 20 percent of our high school students participated in music programs last year. Furthermore, very few of the Solano district’s college-bound students are interested in majoring in music at the university level. Also, when the school district of our neighboring town of Rutherford eliminated its music programs two years ago, the overall grade point average in the high school increased by 10 percent the next year. Surely the money spent on Solano music programs could be better used to improve the quality of traditional academic courses.” ——————————————— The following appeared as part of an article in a local Beauville newspaper. “According to a government report, last year the city of Dillton reduced its corporate tax rate by 15 percent; at the same time, it began offering relocation grants and favorable rates on city utilities to any company that would relocate to Dillton. Within 18 months, two manufacturing companies moved to Dillton, where they employ a total of 300 people. Therefore, the fastest way for Beauville to stimulate economic development and hence reduce unemployment is to provide tax incentives and other financial inducements that encourage private companies to relocate here.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memorandum from the president of Mira Vista College to the college’s board of trustees. “At nearby Green Mountain College, which has more business courses and more job counselors than does Mira Vista College, 90 percent of last year’s graduating seniors had job offers from prospective employers. But at Mira Vista College last year, only 70 percent of the seniors who informed the placement office that they would be seeking employment had found full-time jobs within three months after graduation, and only half of these graduates were employed in their major field of study. To help Mira Vista’s graduates find employment, we must offer more courses in business and computer technology and hire additional job counselors to help students with their resumès and interviewing skills.” ——————————————— The following appeared as an editorial in the local newspaper of Dalton. “When the neighboring town of Williamsville adopted a curfew four months ago that made it illegal for persons under the age of 18 to loiter or idle in public places after 10 p.m., youth crime in Williamsville dropped by 27 percent during curfew hours. In Williamsville’s town square, the area where its citizens were once most outraged at the high crime rate, not a single crime has been reported since the curfew was introduced. Therefore, to help reduce its own rising crime rate, the town of Dalton should adopt the same kind of curfew. A curfew that keeps young people at home late at night will surely control juvenile delinquency and protect minors from becoming victims of crime.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo written by a dean at Buckingham College. “To serve the housing needs of our students, Buckingham College should build a new dormitory. Buckingham’s enrollment is growing and, based on current trends, should double over the next fifty years, thus making existing dormitories inadequate. Moreover, the average rent for an apartment in our town has increased in recent years. Consequently, students will find it increasingly difficult to afford off-campus housing. Finally, an attractive new dormitory would make prospective students more likely to enroll at Buckingham.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo at the XYZ company. “When XYZ lays off employees, it pays Delany Personnel Firm to offer those employees assistance in creating resumès and developing interviewing skills, if they so desire. Laid-off employees have benefited greatly from Delany’s services: last year those who used Delany found jobs much more quickly than did those who did not. Recently, it has been proposed that we use the less-expensive Walsh Personnel Firm in place of Delany. This would be a mistake because eight years ago, when XYZ was using Walsh, only half of the workers we laid off at that time found jobs within a year. Moreover, Delany is clearly superior, as evidenced by its bigger staff and larger number of branch offices. After all, last year Delany’s clients took an average of six months to find jobs, whereas Walsh’s clients took nine.” ——————————————— The following appeared as an editorial in the student newspaper of Groveton College. “To combat the recently reported dramatic rise in cheating among college and university students, these institutions should adopt honor codes similar to Groveton’s, which calls for students to agree not to cheat in their academic endeavors and to notify a faculty member if they suspect that others have cheated. Groveton’s honor code replaced an old-fashioned system in which students were closely monitored by teachers and an average of thirty cases of cheating per year were reported. The honor code has proven far more successful: in the first year it was in place, students reported twenty-one cases of cheating; five years later, this figure had dropped to fourteen. Moreover, in a recent survey conducted by the Groveton honor council, a majority of students said that they would be less likely to cheat with an honor code in place than without.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memorandum written by the vice president of Nature’s Way, a chain of stores selling health food and other health-related products. “Previous experience has shown that our stores are most profitable in areas where residents are highly concerned with leading healthy lives. We should therefore build our next new store in Plainsville, which has many such residents. Plainsville merchants report that sales of running shoes and exercise clothing are at all-time highs. The local health club, which nearly closed five years ago due to lack of business, has more members than ever, and the weight training and aerobics classes are always full. We can even anticipate a new generation of customers: Plainsville’s schoolchildren are required to participate in a ‘fitness for life’ program, which emphasizes the benefits of regular exercise at an early age.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter sent by a committee of homeowners from the Deerhaven Acres to all homeowners in Deerhaven Acres. “Seven years ago, homeowners in nearby Brookville community adopted a set of restrictions on how the community’s yards should be landscaped and what colors the exteriors of homes should be painted. Since then, average property values have tripled in Brookville. In order to raise property values in Deerhaven Acres, we should adopt our own set of restrictions on landscaping and housepainting.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a newspaper article about law firms in the city of Megalopolis. “In Megalopolis, the number of law school graduates who went to work for large, corporate firms declined by 15 percent over the last three years, whereas an increasing number of graduates took jobs at small, general practice firms. Even though large firms usually offer much higher salaries, law school graduates are choosing to work for the smaller firms most likely because they experience greater job satisfaction at smaller firms. In a survey of first-year students at a leading law school, most agreed with the statement that earning a high salary was less important to them than job satisfaction. This finding suggests that the large, corporate firms of Megalopolis will need to offer graduates more benefits and incentives and reduce the number of hours they must work.” ——————————————— The following was posted on an Internet real estate discussion site. “Of the two leading real estate firms in our town — Adams Realty and Fitch Realty — Adams is clearly superior. Adams has 40 real estate agents. In contrast, Fitch has 25, many of whom work only part-time. Moreover, Adams’ revenue last year was twice as high as that of Fitch, and included home sales that averaged $168,000, compared to Fitch’s $144,000. Homes listed with Adams sell faster as well: Ten years ago, I listed my home with Fitch and it took more than four months to sell; last year, when I sold another home, I listed it with Adams, and it took only one month. Thus, if you want to sell your home quickly and at a good price, you should use Adams.” ——————————————— The following appeared in the business section of a newspaper. “Given that the number of people in our country with some form of arthritis is expected to rise from 40 million to 60 million over the next twenty years, pharmaceutical companies that produce drugs for the treatment of arthritis should be very profitable. Many analysts believe that in ten years Becton Pharmaceuticals, which makes Xenon, the best-selling drug treatment for arthritis, will be the most profitable pharmaceutical company. But the patent on Xenon expires in three years, and other companies will then be able to produce a cheaper version of the drug. Thus, it is more likely that in ten years the most profitable pharmaceutical company will be Perkins Pharmaceuticals, maker of a new drug called Xylan, which clinical studies show is preferred over Xenon by seven out of ten patients suffering from the most extreme cases of arthritis.” ——————————————— The following was written as a part of an application for a small business loan by a group of developers in the city of Monroe. “A jazz music club in Monroe would be a tremendously profitable enterprise. Currently, the nearest jazz club is 65 miles away; thus, our proposed club, the C Note, would have the local market all to itself. Plus, jazz is extremely popular in Monroe: over 100,000 people attended Monroe’s jazz festival last summer, several well-known jazz musicians live in Monroe, and the highest-rated radio program in Monroe is ‘Jazz Nightly,’ which airs every weeknight. Finally, a nationwide study indicates that the typical jazz fan spends close to $1,000 per year on jazz entertainment. It is clear that the C Note cannot help but make money.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter to the editor of the Clearview newspaper. “In the next mayoral election, residents of Clearview should vote for Ann Green, who is a member of the Good Earth Coalition, rather than for Frank Braun, a member of the Clearview town council, because the current members are not protecting our environment. For example, during the past year the number of factories in Clearview has doubled, air pollution levels have increased, and the local hospital has treated 25 percent more patients with respiratory illnesses. If we elect Ann Green, the environmental problems in Clearview will certainly be solved.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memorandum issued by the strategic planning department at Omni Inc. “Mesa Foods, a manufacturer of snack foods that currently markets its products within a relatively small region of the country, has strong growth potential. Mesa enjoyed a 20 percent increase in profits last year, and its best-selling product, Diabolique Salsa, has had increased sales over each of the past three years. Since Omni Inc. is interested in reaching 14-to-25 year olds, the age group that consumes the most snack food, we should buy Mesa Foods, and concentrate in particular on marketing Diabolique Salsa throughout the country.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memorandum from a dean at Omega University. “Fifteen years ago, Omega University implemented a new procedure that encouraged students to evaluate the teaching effectiveness of all their professors. Since that time, Omega professors have begun to assign higher grades in their classes, and overall student grade averages at Omega have risen by thirty percent. Potential employers apparently believe the grades at Omega are inflated; this would explain why Omega graduates have not been as successful at getting jobs as have graduates from nearby Alpha University. To enable its graduates to secure better jobs, Omega University should now terminate student evaluation of professors.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter to the editor of a Batavia newspaper. “The department of agriculture in Batavia reports that the number of dairy farms throughout the country is now 25 percent greater than it was 10 years ago. During this same time period, however, the price of milk at the local Excello Food Market has increased from $1.50 to over $3.00 per gallon. To prevent farmers from continuing to receive excessive profits on an apparently increased supply of milk, the Batavia government should begin to regulate retail milk prices. Such regulation is necessary to ensure both lower prices and an adequate supply of milk for consumers.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the mayor of the town of West Egg. “Two years ago, our consultants predicted that West Egg’s landfill, which is used for garbage disposal, would be completely filled within five years. During the past two years, however, town residents have been recycling twice as much aluminum and paper as they did in previous years. Next month the amount of material recycled should further increase, since charges for garbage pickup will double. Furthermore, over ninety percent of the respondents to a recent survey said that they would do more recycling in the future. Because of our residents’ strong commitment to recycling, the available space in our landfill should last for considerably longer than predicted.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from a vice president of Alta Manufacturing. “During the past year, Alta Manufacturing had thirty percent more on-the-job accidents than nearby Panoply Industries, where the work shifts are one hour shorter than ours. Experts believe that a significant contributing factor in many on-the-job accidents is fatigue and sleep deprivation among workers. Therefore, to reduce the number of on-the-job accidents at Alta and thereby increase productivity, we should shorten each of our three work shifts by one hour so that our employees will get adequate amounts of sleep.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the chief executive of a video game company. “We have recently been offered the opportunity to buy the rights to produce a video game based on the soon-to-be-published children’s book ‘Squirrel Power,’ by Peter Wood. While the cost of the rights is substantial and will place economic constraints on our company in the short-term, there are two reasons that the purchase of these rights will undoubtedly be a wise investment. First, Wood’s last three books have been best sellers and the movie based on his first book was highly profitable. Second, the popular characters and story line in ‘Squirrel Power’ will save us time in developing our video game, thereby reducing our costs.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the owner of Green Thumb Gardening Center, a small business serving a suburban town. “There is evidence that consumers are becoming more and more interested in growing their own vegetables. A national survey conducted last month indicated that many consumers were dissatisfied with the quality of fresh vegetables available in supermarkets. And locally, the gardening magazine GreatGardens has sold out at the Village News stand three months in a row. Thus, we at Green Thumb Gardening Center can increase our profits by greatly expanding the variety of vegetable seeds we stock for gardeners this coming spring.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a newsletter offering advice to investors. “Over 80 percent of the respondents to a recent survey indicated a desire to reduce their intake of foods containing fats and cholesterol, and today low-fat products abound in many food stores. Since many of the food products currently marketed by Old Dairy Industries are high in fat and cholesterol, the company’s sales are likely to diminish greatly and their profits will no doubt decrease. We therefore advise Old Dairy stockholders to sell their shares and other investors not to purchase stock in this company.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter to the editor of a local newspaper from a citizen of the state of Impecunia. “Two years ago our neighboring state, Lucria, began a state lottery to supplement tax revenues for education and public health. Today, Lucria spends more per pupil than we do, and Lucria’s public health program treats far more people than our state’s program does. If we were to establish a state lottery like the one in Lucria, the profits could be used to improve our educational system and public health program. The new lottery would doubtless be successful, because a survey conducted in our capital city concludes that citizens of Impecunia already spend an average of $50 per person per year on gambling.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter to the editor of the Walnut Grove town newspaper. “Walnut Grove’s town council has advocated switching from EZ Disposal (which has had the contract for trash collection services in Walnut Grove for the past ten years) to ABC Waste, because EZ recently raised its monthly fee from $2,000 to $2,500 a month, whereas ABC’s fee is still $2,000. But the town council is mistaken; we should continue using EZ. EZ collects trash twice a week, while ABC collects only once. Moreover, EZ — which, like ABC, currently has a fleet of 20 trucks — has ordered additional trucks. Finally, EZ provides exceptional service: 80 percent of respondents to last year’s town survey agreed that they were ‘satisfied’ with EZ’s performance.” ——————————————— The following appeared in an editorial in a Prunty County newspaper. “In an attempt to improve highway safety, Prunty County recently lowered its speed limit from 55 miles per hour to 45 on all major county roads. But the 55 mph limit should be restored, because this safety effort has failed. Most drivers are exceeding the new speed limit and the accident rate throughout Prunty County has decreased only slightly. If we want to improve the safety of our roads, we should instead undertake the same kind of road improvement project that Butler County completed five years ago: increasing lane widths and resurfacing rough roads. Today, major Butler County roads still have a 55 mph speed limit, yet there were 25 percent fewer reported accidents in Butler County this past year than there were five years ago.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter from the manager of a rock band named Double Rice. “One year ago, tickets for Double Rice’s concerts in stadiums around the country took, on average, at least 24 hours to sell out, if they sold out at all. But the band has been enjoying a surge in nationwide popularity among 14 to 25 year olds, and the 30,000 tickets for a recent concert in Megalopolis sold out in 12 minutes. Clearly the ticket sales in Megalopolis are a result both of the band’s increased popularity and of the advertising campaign run in Megalopolis by the Ad Lib advertising agency. Thus, in order to ensure that the band’s success in Megalopolis is repeated across the country, the band should hire Ad Lib to duplicate the Megalopolis ad campaign on a nationwide scale.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter to the editor of the Balmer Island Gazette. “The population of Balmer Island increases to 100,000 duing the summer months. To reduce the number of accidents involving mopeds and pedestrians, the town council of Balmer Island should limit the number of mopeds rented by each of the island’s six moped and bicycle rental companies from 50 per day to 30 per day during the summer season. By limiting the number of rentals, the town council is sure to attain the 50 percent reduction in moped accidents that was achieved last year in the neighboring island of Torseau, when Torseau’s town council enforced similar limits on moped rentals.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the new vice president of Sartorian, a company that manufactures men’s clothing. “Five years ago, at a time when we had difficulties in obtaining reliable supplies of high-quality wool fabric, we discontinued production of our deluxe alpaca overcoats. Now that we have a new fabric supplier, we should resume production. This coat should sell very well: since we have not offered an alpaca overcoat for five years and since our major competitor no longer makes an alpaca overcoat, there will be pent-up customer demand. Also, since the price of most types of clothing has risen in each of the past five years, customers should be willing to pay significantly higher prices for alpaca overcoats than they did five years ago, and our company profits will increase.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the president of a company that builds and sells new homes in Steel City. “Over the past five years, the population of Steel City has increased by more than 20 percent, and family incomes in Steel City have risen much faster than the national average. Nationwide, sales of houses priced above $150,000 have increased more than have sales of lower-priced houses. Such data indicate that we should make changes in our business to increase company profits. First, we should build fewer low-priced houses than we did last year and focus instead on building houses designed to sell at above $150,000. Second, we should hire additional workers so that we can build a larger total number of houses than we did last year.” ——————————————— A recent sales study indicated that consumption of seafood dishes in Bay City restaurants has increased by 30 percent over the past five years. Yet there are no currently operating city restaurants that specialize in seafood. Moreover, the majority of families in Bay City are two-income families, and a nationwide study has shown that such families eat significantly fewer home-cooked meals than they did a decade ago but at the same time express more concern about eating healthily. Therefore, a new Bay City restaurant specializing in seafood will be quite popular and profitable. ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the president of Viva-Tech, a manufacturer of high-tech medical equipment. “In order to reduce costs, we should close some of our existing small assembly plants and build a large central plant. Grandview would be an ideal location for this new plant. First, of the locations that we have considered, Grandview has the largest adult population, so that we will be able to staff our plant quickly and easily. Second, since the average wage earned by workers in Grandview is less than that in the other locations, we should be able to keep production costs low. Last, as an inducement for us to build there, Grandview’s town council has offered to allow us to operate for the first three years without paying city taxes.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the mayor of the town of Hopewell. “Two years ago, the town of Ocean View built a new municipal golf course and resort hotel. During the past two years, tourism in Ocean View has increased, new businesses have opened there, and Ocean View’s tax revenues have risen by 30 percent. The best way to improve Hopewell’s economy, and generate additional tax revenues, is to build a golf course and resort hotel similar to those in Ocean View.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the chairperson of the school board in the town of Saluda. “For the past five years, Mr. Charles Schade has been the music director at Steel City High School, and during that time the school band from Steel City High has won three regional band competitions. In addition, the quality of the music rehearsal facilities and musical instruments at Steel City High has improved markedly over the past five years. Because of such successes at Steel City High, the Saluda school board should hire Mr. Schade to plan and direct the general music education programs for the entire Saluda school system.” ——————————————— The following appeared as part of a memo from the president of Automate, a company that manufactures automobiles. “It has come to my attention that Sparks, Inc., the manufacturing company that just moved into our state, is advertising job openings at salaries that are twice as high as those paid to our experienced assembly-line workers. Some of our employees have already left to work for Sparks. In order to keep our best staff, we must pay them salaries equal to those Sparks pays its employees. Otherwise we will continue to lose employees in the future, because Sparks must staff the additional new plants that it plans to build in the state.” ——————————————— The following is a memo from the superintendent of the Mylar school district. “A recent six-month study, in which breakfast was made available at school for 100 schoolchildren ages five to twelve, found that children on the breakfast plan were less likely than other children to be absent from or late for school. Clearly, eating breakfast before school plays a role in reducing student absenteeism and tardiness. It is also well known that children who regularly eat a healthful breakfast tend to perform better in school. Therefore, in order to reduce absenteeism and tardiness and to improve academic performance in all of Mylar’s elementary and secondary schools, we should provide breakfasts for all students before each school day.” ——————————————— When Ida McAllister ran for mayor of Lake City four years ago, she failed to win even 30 percent of the vote. But since then, McAllister has made public her commitment to environmental causes. She would be wise, therefore, to announce her intention to close all Lake City parks to automobile traffic, thus following the example of the former mayor of Plainsville, Alecia Yu . On the recommendation of a small group of concerned citizens, Mayor Yu prohibited automobile traffic in all Plainsville parks, and therefore was credited with solving the pollution problem and improving the quality of life in Plainsville. This action would have great appeal to the citizens of Lake City, most of whom participate in the community’s recycling program, and would guarantee McAllister’s success in her current quest to be Lake City’s new mayor. ——————————————— According to information recently reported in the Eliottown Gazette, the number of people who travel to Eliottown has increased significantly over the past several years. So far this year over 100,000 people have arrived on flights to Eliottown’s airport, compared with only 80,000 last year and 40,000 the year before. Eliottown’s train station has received more than 50,000 passengers this year, compared with less than 40,000 last year and 20,000 the year before. Clearly tourism in Eliottown has been increasing, thanks to the new Central Park and Museum of Modern Art that opened last year. Therefore, the funding for the park and museum should be increased significantly. ——————————————— The following appeared in the editorial section of a newsmagazine. “Some states are creating new laws that restrict the use of handheld cell phones by drivers of automobiles. Such legislation, however, is sheer folly. Although some people with cell phones undoubtedly cause problems on the road, including serious accidents, the majority do not. Besides, problems are also caused by drivers who are distracted by any number of other activities, from listening to the radio to disciplining children. Since there is no need to pass legislation restricting these and other such activities, it follows that there is no need to restrict people’s freedom to use a device that they find convenient — or helpful in emergencies.” ——————————————— Until recently, people in Hiparia did most of their shopping by driving to shopping malls. They are beginning, however, to do more of their shopping by ordering merchandise from mail-order catalogs and the Internet. These purchases are delivered to them by mail or by a delivery service. For many purchases, Hiparians no longer need to drive to and from shopping malls; there will therefore be a resulting reduction in the consumption of vehicle fuel in Hiparia. ——————————————— The following report appeared in an archaeology journal. “The discovery of distinctively shaped ceramic pots at various prehistoric sites scattered over a wide area has led archaeologists to ask how the pots were spread. Some believe the pot makers migrated to the various sites and carried the pots along with them; others believe the pots were spread by trade and their makers remained in one place. Now, analysis of the bones of prehistoric human skeletons can settle the debate: high levels of a certain metallic element contained in various foods are strongly associated with people who migrated to a new place after childhood. Many of the bones found near the pots at a few sites showed high levels of the metallic element. Therefore, it must be that the pots were spread by migration, not trade.” ——————————————— Milk and dairy products are rich in vitamin D and calcium, substances essential for building and maintaining bones. Many people therefore believe that a diet rich in dairy products can help prevent osteoporosis, a disease in which the bones weaken significantly with age and that is linked to both environmental and genetic factors. But a long-term study of a large number of people has found that those who have consistently consumed dairy products throughout the years of the study have a higher rate of bone fractures than any other participants in the study. Since bone fractures are a symptom of osteoporosis, this study result shows that a diet rich in dairy products may actually increase, rather than decrease, the risk of osteoporosis. ——————————————— The following appeared in the summary of a study on headaches suffered by the residents of Mentia. “Salicylates are members of the same chemical family as aspirin, a medicine used to treat headaches. Although many foods are naturally rich in salicylates, for the past several decades food-processing companies have also been adding salicylates to foods as preservatives. This rise in the commercial use of salicylates has been found to correlate with a steady decline in the average number of headaches reported by participants in our twenty-year study. Recently, food-processing companies have found that salicylates can also be used as flavor additives for foods. With this new use for salicylates, we can expect a continued steady decline in the number of headaches suffered by the average citizen of Mentia.” ——————————————— The following appeared in an article written by Dr. Karp, an anthropologist. “Twenty years ago Dr. Field, a noted anthropologist, visited the island of Tertia and concluded from his observations that children in Tertia were reared by an entire village rather than by their own biological parents. However, my recent interviews with children living in the group of islands that includes Tertia show that these children spend much more time talking about their biological parents than about other adults in the village. This research proves that Dr. Field’s conclusion about Tertian village culture is false, and thus that the observation-centered approach to studying cultures is invalid. Because they are using the interview-centered method, my team of graduate students working in Tertia will establish a much more accurate understanding of child-rearing traditions there and in other island cultures.” ——————————————— Woven baskets characterized by a particular distinctive pattern have previously been found only in the immediate vicinity of the prehistoric village of Palea and therefore were believed to have been unique to the Palean people. Recently, however, archaeologists discovered such a ‘Palean’ basket in Lithos, an ancient village across the BrimRiver from Palea. The BrimRiver is very deep and broad, and so the ancient Paleans could only have crossed it by boat, but there is no evidence that the Paleans had boats. And boats capable of carrying groups of people and cargo were not developed until thousands of years after the Palean people disappeared. Moreover, Paleans would have had no need to cross the river — the woods around Palea are full of nuts, berries, and small game. It follows that the so-called Palean baskets were not unique to Palea. ——————————————— The following memo appeared in the newsletter of the West Meria Public Health Council. “An innovative treatment has come to our attention that promises to significantly reduce absenteeism in our schools and workplaces. A study reports that in nearby East Meria, where fish consumption is very high, people visit the doctor only once or twice per year for the treatment of colds. Clearly, eating a substantial amount of fish can prevent colds. Since colds are the reason most frequently given for absences from school and work, we recommend the daily use of Ichthaid, a nutritional supplement derived from fish oil, as a good way to prevent colds and lower absenteeism.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memorandum from the president of Humana College. “Last year the number of students who enrolled in long-distance degree programs at OmniU niversity increased by 50%. During the same year, Omni showed a significant decrease from prior years in expenditures for dormitory and classroom space, most likely because instruction in the long-distance programs takes place via interactive video computer connections. In contrast, over the past three years, enrollment at Humana College has diminished and costs of maintaining buildings have risen. Thus, to increase enrollment and solve the problem of budget deficits at Humana College, we should initiate and actively promote long-distance degree programs like those at Omni.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memorandum from the president of Excello Food Markets. “In 90 towns where Excello has food markets, natural-food stores specializing in organic food products — products containing no chemical preservatives and made with foods grown without pesticides — have opened nearby as competitors. Surveys of our own customers reveal a growing concern about foods grown using pesticides or preserved with chemicals. Recently our market in Sun City participated in a local food tasting fair, and 75 percent of the fair goers who visited the Excello booth requested free samples of organic fruit. Such evidence indicates that to increase our profits, we should begin to stock a full line of organic food products in all our markets.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the vice president of a food-distribution company with food-storage warehouses in several cities. “Recently we signed a contract with The Fly-Away Pest-Control Company to provide pest-control services at our fast-food warehouse in Palm City, but last month we discovered that over $20,000 worth of food there had been destroyed by pest damage. Meanwhile, the Buzzoff Pest-Control Company, which we have used for many years, continued to service our warehouse in Wintervale, and last month only $10,000 worth of the food stored there had been destroyed by pest damage. Even though the price charged by Fly-Away is considerably lower, our best means of saving money is to return to Buzzoff Company for all our pest-control services.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a proposal from the economic minister of the country of Paraterra. “In order to strengthen its lagging economy, last year the government of the nearby country of Bellegea began an advertising campaign to promote ecologically sound tourism (ecotourism). This year, the number of foreign visitors arriving at Bellegea’s main airport doubled, and per capita income in Bellegea increased by ten percent. To provide more income for the population of Paraterra and also preserve the natural environment of our tiny country, we too should begin to promote ecotourism. To ensure that our advertising campaign is successful, we should hire the current director of Bellegea’s National Tourism Office as a consultant for the campaign.” ——————————————— The following appeared as part of a business plan developed by the manager of the Rialto Theater. “Despite its downtown location, the Rialto Movie Theater, a local institution for five decades, must make big changes or close its doors forever. It should follow the example of the new Apex Theater in the mall outside of town. When the Apex opened last year, it featured a video arcade, plush carpeting and seats, and a state-of-the-art sound system. Furthermore, in a recent survey, over 85 percent of respondents reported that the high price of newly released movies prevents them from going to the movies more than five times per year. Thus, if the Rialto intends to hold on to its share of a decreasing pool of moviegoers, it must offer the same features as Apex.” ——————————————— The following is a recommendation from the business manager of Monarch Books. “Monarch Books should open a cafè in its store to attract more customers and better compete with Regal Books, which recently opened a cafè. Monarch, which has been in business at the same location for more than twenty years, has a large customer following because it is known for its wide selection of books on all subjects. Opening the cafè would clearly attract more customers. The cafè would require relatively little space. Space could be made for the cafè by discontinuing the children’s book section, which will likely become less popular given that the last national census indicated a significant decline in the percent of the population who are under age ten.” ——————————————— The following appeared as an editorial in a wildlife journal. “Arctic deer live on islands in Canada’s arctic region. They search for food by moving over ice from island to island during the course of a year. Their habitat is limited to areas warm enough to sustain the plants on which they feed, and cold enough, at least some of the year, for the ice to cover the sea separating the islands, allowing the deer to travel over it. Unfortunately, according to reports from local hunters, the deer populations are declining. Since these reports coincide with recent global warming trends that have caused the sea ice to melt, we can conclude that the decline in arctic deer populations is the result of deer being unable to follow their age-old migration patterns across the frozen sea.” ——————————————— Although black bears are common in the eastern Canadian province of Labrador, grizzly bears — often similar in color, but much larger — were believed to exist only in the western provinces. Despite a nineteenth-century explorer’s account of having startled and narrowly escaped from a grizzly bear deep in the woods in Labrador, modern scientists find no physical evidence that grizzly bears have ever lived in Labrador. But recent research into the language and legends of the Innu, a people who have lived in Labrador for thousands of years, reveals that their language has words for two different kinds of bears, and their ancient legends attribute different characteristics to the two kinds of bears. Therefore, there probably were grizzly bears in Labrador, and the explorer’s account probably accurately identified the bear. ——————————————— Scientists studying historical weather patterns have discovered that in the mid-sixth century, Earth suddenly became significantly cooler. Although few historical records survive from that time, some accounts found both in Asia and Europe mention a dimming of the sun and extremely cold temperatures. Either a huge volcanic eruption or a large meteorite colliding with Earth could have created a large dust cloud throughout Earth’s atmosphere that would have been capable of blocking enough sunlight to lower global temperatures significantly. A large meteorite collision, however, would probably create a sudden bright flash of light, and no extant historical records of the time mention such a flash. Some surviving Asian historical records of the time, however, mention a loud boom that would be consistent with a volcanic eruption. Therefore, the cooling was probably caused by a volcanic eruption. ——————————————— The following appeared in a newspaper article published in the country of Corpora. “Twenty years ago, one half of all citizens in Corpora met the standards for adequate physical fitness as then defined by the national advisory board on physical fitness. Today, the board says that only one quarter of all citizens are adequately fit and suggests that spending too much time using computers may be the reason. But since overall fitness levels are highest in regions of Corpora where levels of computer ownership are also highest, it is clear that using computers has not made citizens less physically fit. Instead, as shown by this year’s unusually low expenditures on fitness-related products and services, the recent decline in the economy is most likely the cause, and fitness levels will improve when the economy does.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter to the editor of a newsletter on health issues. “For the past decade, most health experts have advised teenagers to avoid eating greasy foods in order to prevent acne and related skin conditions, but the number of teenagers who sought medical help for these skin problems has actually risen over the same period. In a recent study, teenagers who avoided greasy foods for a month reported approximately as many outbreaks of acne and related skin conditions as did those who ate an average of two servings of greasy food per day. Such data indicate that eating greasy foods is unlikely to be a cause of acne and related skin conditions. Therefore, health experts should no longer recommend that people avoid such foods.” ——————————————— From a draft textbook manuscript submitted to a publisher. “As Earth was being formed out of the collision of space rocks, the heat from those collisions and from the increasing gravitational energy of the planet made the entire planet molten, even the surface. Any water present would have evaporated and gone off into space. As the planet approached its current size, however, its gravitation became strong enough to hold gases and water vapor around it as an atmosphere. Because comets are largely ice made up of frozen water and gases, a comet striking Earth then would have vaporized. The resulting water vapor would have been retained in the atmosphere, eventually falling as rain on the cooled and solidified surface of Earth. Therefore, the water in Earth’s oceans must have originated from comets.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a medical newsletter. “Doctors have long suspected that secondary infections may keep some patients from healing quickly after severe muscle strain. This hypothesis has now been proved by preliminary results of a study of two groups of patients. The first group of patients, all being treated for muscle injuries by Dr. Newland, a doctor who specializes in sports medicine, took antibiotics regularly throughout their treatment. Their recuperation time was, on average, 40 percent quicker than typically expected. Patients in the second group, all being treated by Dr. Alton, a general physician, were given sugar pills, although the patients believed they were taking antibiotics. Their average recuperation time was not significantly reduced. Therefore, all patients who are diagnosed with muscle strain would be well advised to take antibiotics as part of their treatment. “ ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo to the human resources manager at Baobob Inc., a large architectural firm. “Several well-known, retired architects were interviewed in Architecture Today about changes in the field. Only one had earned a college degree in architecture. All others had come into the field at an early age by serving apprenticeships that required them to work under the direct supervision of an experienced architect. Several of the colleges that we recruit from report that many promising architecture students leave school early in their undergraduate career. Therefore, because finding talented architecture graduates is becoming more difficult, Baobob Inc. should start an aggressive apprenticeship program and hire students who express an interest in architecture directly out of high school rather than wait for them to get out of college.” ——————————————— Thirteen years ago, researchers studied a group of 25 infants who showed signs of mild distress when exposed to unfamiliar stimuli such as an unusual odor or a tape recording of an unknown voice. They discovered that these infants were more likely than other infants to have been conceived in early autumn, a time when their mothers’ production of melatonin — a hormone known to affect some brain functions — would naturally increase in response to decreased daylight. In a follow-up study conducted earlier this year, more than half of these children — now teenagers — who had shown signs of distress identified themselves as shy. Clearly, increased levels of melatonin before birth cause shyness during infancy and this shyness continues into later life. ——————————————— The following appeared in a newsletter on dental health. “A recent research study reported the experience of dentists whose patients had, over a period of five years, regularly used Flux Dental Floss as part of their dental hygiene routine. The report indicates that these dentists had 50 percent fewer cases of gum disease than did dentists whose patients did not use Flux regularly. In addition, most of the Flux users who were surveyed by their dentists agreed that Flux’s mint flavor would encourage people to floss more often. Thus, even though Flux may cost more than other brands of floss, it is clearly a worthwhile investment for those who want to be assured of healthy teeth and gums.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a Letter to the Editor of the Shady Village newspaper. “Commuters are complaining that the rush hour traffic on Blue Highway between Shady Village and Bright City has doubled their commuting time. Some commuters have asked that an additional traffic lane be built, but the recent creation of such a lane on nearby Green Highway apparently attracted more commuters, judging from the fact that rush-hour traffic jams actually increased there this past winter. To reduce rush-hour traffic on Blue Highway, a bicycle lane should be added instead of a traffic lane. This approach will succeed because many citizens of Shady Village are avid bicyclists; 75 percent of respondents to a recent questionnaire distributed there said they would like to bicycle more hours per week than they currently do.” ——————————————— Collectors prize the ancient life-size clay statues of human figures made on Kali Island but have long wondered how the Kalinese artists were able to depict bodies with such realistic precision. Since archeologists have recently discovered molds of human heads and hands on Kali, we can now conclude that the ancient Kalinese artists used molds of actual bodies, not sculpting tools and techniques, to create these statues. This discovery explains why Kalinese miniature statues were abstract and entirely different in style: molds could only be used for life-size sculptures. It also explains why few ancient Kalinese sculpting tools have been found. In light of this development, collectors should expect the life-size sculptures to decrease in value and the miniatures to increase in value. ——————————————— The following appeared in a newsletter on nutrition and health. “Although the multimineral Zorba pill was designed as a simple dietary supplement, a study of first-time ulcer patients who took Zorba suggests that Zorba actually helps prevent ulcers. The study showed that only 25 percent of those ulcer patients who took Zorba under a doctor’s direction developed new ulcers, compared to a 75 percent recurrence rate among ulcer patients who did not take Zorba. Clearly, then, Zorba will be highly effective in preventing recurrent ulcers and if health experts inform the general public of this fact, many first-time ulcers can be prevented as well.” ——————————————— The following appeared in an article from a popular newsmagazine. “In 1888 a stone was unearthed in northern Wisconsin with an inscription in an old Scandinavian alphabet and bearing the date 1362. Scandinavians were not, however, exploring or emigrating to northern Wisconsin in the fourteenth century. Recent analysis proves, in fact, that the stone had been buried in the spot where it was found for no more than 100 years. Moreover, the community near the discovery site was home to a group of people who had formed a club to study medieval Scandinavian culture — a period that includes the fourteenth century. The stone, therefore, is not a genuine artifact of medieval Scandinavian culture inscribed in the fourteenth century but most likely a hoax perpetrated by the group.” ——————————————— The following appeared in an article in the health section of a newspaper. “According to the available medical records, the six worst worldwide flu epidemics during the past 300 years occurred in 1729, 1830, 1918, 1957, 1968, and 1977. These were all years with heavy sunspot activity — that is, years when the Earth received significantly more solar energy than in normal years. People at particular risk for the flu should therefore avoid prolonged exposure to the Sun.” ——————————————— The following appeared in the health section of Glenntown’s local newspaper. “Several national medical studies suggest that older people who have pets tend to enjoy better health than those who do not have pets: those who have pets have lower rates of high blood pressure and arthritis. It seems clear that having to care for an animal promotes good health for the older person. Therefore, Glenntown should establish a program to give a small pet such as a dog or cat to all of its citizens who are over the age of 65. This will help to insure that our senior citizens enjoy good health and have fewer medical bills.” ——————————————- The following appeared in a report by the School District of Eyleria. “Nationally, the average ratio of computers to students in kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) is 1:5. Educators indicate that this is very good ratio. This means that across the country, all students have access to and can use computers daily in their classrooms. In Eyleria’s K-12 schools, the ratio of computers to students is 1:7. This number is sufficient to ensure that all of Eyleria’s students, by the time they graduate from high school, will be fully proficient in the use of computer technology. Thus, there is no reason to spend any of the schools’ budget on computers or other technology in the next few years.” ——————————————- The Treasury has once again introduced a dollar coin, the Pine Tree dollar. Neither the Presidential dollar coin, introduced 11 years ago, nor the Eagle dollar coin, introduced 3 years ago, remained in circulation long: people simply preferred spending paper dollars. However, a survey conducted soon after its release indicates that the Pine Tree dollar is far more appealing than other dollar coins: 76 percent of respondents own the coin; 62 percent of those owning multiple coins consider it so attractive that they are still saving rather than spending the most recent coin to come into their possession. Since the Pine Tree coin promises to become the dollar currency of choice, the Treasury is correct to begin saving money by dramatically reducing the costly printing of paper dollars. ——————————————— When Stanley Park first opened, it was the largest, most heavily used park in town. It is still the largest park, but it is no longer heavily used. Video cameras mounted in the park’s parking lots last month revealed the park’s drop in popularity: the recordings showed an average of only 50 cars per day. In contrast, tiny Carlton Park in the heart of the business district is visited by more than 150 people on a typical weekday. An obvious difference is that Carlton Park, unlike Stanley Park, provides ample seating. Thus, if Stanley Park is ever to be as popular with our citizens as is Carlton Park, the town will obviously need to provide more benches, thereby converting some of the unused open areas into spaces suitable for socializing. ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the Dean of the College of Education at Omni State University. “Only seven of our state’s high schools offer even one course in Latin, but over 80 percent of the graduates who study Latin at those seven schools enroll in college. Furthermore, a recent study shows that students who have mastered Latin perform much better in logic and critical thinking. Thus, in order to increase the percentage of our high school students who graduate from college as well as to ensure that they receive a better education in critical thinking, Omni State University should begin an intensive program to prepare our future teachers to teach high school Latin.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the president of a chain of cheese stores located throughout the United States. “For many years all the stores in our chain have stocked a wide variety of both domestic and imported cheeses. Last year, however, the five best-selling cheeses at our newest store were all domestic cheddar cheeses from Wisconsin. Furthermore, a recent survey by Cheeses of the World magazine indicates an increasing preference for domestic cheeses among its subscribers. Since our company can reduce expenses by limiting inventory, the best way to improve profits in all of our stores is to discontinue stocking many of our varieties of imported cheese and concentrate primarily on domestic cheeses.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter from a firm providing investment advice to a client. “Homes in the northeastern United States, where winters are typically cold, have traditionally used oil as their major fuel for heating. Last year that region experienced 90 days with below-average temperatures, and climate forecasters at Waymarsh University predict that this weather pattern will continue for several more years. Furthermore, many new homes have been built in this region during the past year. Because of these developments, we predict an increased demand for heating oil and recommend investment in Consolidated Industries, one of whose major business operations is the retail sale of home heating oil.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter to the editor of a newspaper serving the villages of Castorville and Polluxton. “Both the villages of Castorville and Polluxton have experienced sharp declines in the numbers of residents who pay property taxes. To save money and improve service, the two villages recently merged their once separate garbage collection departments into a single department located in Castorville, and the new department has reported few complaints about its service. Last year the library in Polluxton had 20 percent fewer users than during the previous year. It follows that we should now further economize and improve service, as we did with garbage collection, by closing the library in Polluxton and using the library in Castorville to serve both villages.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from a budget planner for the City of Grandview. “To avoid a budget deficit next year, the City of Grandview must eliminate its funding for the Grandview Symphony. Our citizens are well aware of the fact that while the Grandview Symphony Orchestra was struggling to succeed, our city government promised annual funding to help support its programs. Last year, however, private contributions to the Symphony increased by 200 percent, and attendance at the Symphony’s concerts-in-the-park series doubled. The Symphony has also announced an increase in ticket prices for next year. Such developments indicate that the Symphony can now succeed without funding from city government and we can eliminate that expense from next year’s budget. This action will surely prevent a budget deficit.” ——————————————— Yellow-legged frogs were once common in high-altitude lakes in the Sierra Nevada mountains, but they have become increasingly rare. Trout feed on tadpoles and young frogs. Few lakes in the Sierra Nevada had any trout in them until a hundred years ago. At that time, many lakes were stocked with trout for recreational fishing, and now trout are common in virtually all bodies of water in the Sierra Nevada. Researchers removed the trout from one lake, and the frog population soon quadrupled. Since frogs are capable of moving several miles over land, removing trout from just a few lakes is clearly the way to restore the frog population to its former levels. ——————————————— Studies show that in 70 percent of traffic accidents, at least one driver involved is less than 10 miles from home when the accident occurs. This statistic indicates that drivers have a tendency to drive incautiously when they are close to home, probably because familiar surroundings give them a false sense of security. Thus, the places where people feel safest are the places where they are in fact at greatest risk of serious injury. ——————————————— Copper occurs in nature mixed with other minerals and valuable metals in ore, and the proportion of copper in the ore can vary considerably. Until fairly recently, the only way to extract pure copper from ore was by using a process that requires large amounts of electric energy, especially if the proportion of copper in the ore is low. New copper-extracting technologies can use up to 40 percent less electricity than the older method to process the same amount of raw ore, especially when the proportion of copper in the ore is high. Therefore, we can expect the amount of electricity used by the copper-extraction industry to decline significantly. ——————————————— In measuring electrical activity in different parts of the brain, researchers found that people who describe themselves as generally happy have more activity in the left prefrontal lobe of their brains than do other people. Therefore, a medication for stimulating the left prefrontal lobe of the brain would be an effective treatment for clinical depression. ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from a manager of a car dealership. “Ten years ago, long-term car leasing became available in our country of Mohilia as an alternative to outright car ownership, and leasing has steadily risen in popularity. For each of the last five years, the number of people leasing new cars has surpassed the number buying new cars. The average age of cars driven in Mohilia is six years; hence, if new car leases again outnumber purchases this year, it is likely that the majority of drivers will be driving leased, not individually owned, cars. Therefore, we should change the focus of our business from selling cars to leasing them.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a newsletter about education policy. ‘The average annual earnings of high school dropouts are significantly less than the average annual earnings of high school graduates. To address this problem, the state governor has proposed that the state should establish free vocational training programs for high school dropouts. But the availability of such programs would probably encourage some students who would otherwise have graduated to drop out in order to pursue vocational training. Hence the proposed programs would lower, not raise, the average earning potential of young people. Therefore, the state should not establish the vocational training programs but should instead focus on improving academic programs in our high schools.’ ——————————————— The following appeared in a newsletter about health. “The proportion of children in the United States who are overweight is greater now than ever before. Obesity rates among children have been increasing since the 1970’s and, during that same time period, the proportion of children living in suburbs has increased. Whereas children in rural areas tend to have outdoor active chores and children in cities often walk to school or other places they need to go, children in suburbs are typically driven everywhere. Thus the increase in childhood obesity is probably due mainly to the suburbanization of America and the associated decrease in the opportunities children have for exercise.” ——————————————— The following appeared as part of an article in a health and beauty magazine. “A group of volunteers participated in a study of consumer responses to the new Luxess face cream. Every morning for a month, they washed their faces with mild soap and then applied Luxess. At the end of that month, most volunteers reported a marked improvement in the way their skin looked and felt. Thus it appears that Luxess is truly effective in improving the condition of facial skin.” ——————————————— The cities of East Sacunda and West Sacunda are in an earthquake-prone area. Since 1985 both cities have had stringent building codes requiring all new buildings to have specific features designed to prevent damage in an earthquake. Buildings built before 1985 are exempt from the codes, but many building owners have modified their buildings to make them conform to the 1985 codes. Last year a major earthquake hit the area, and many people lost their homes. The number of people who were left homeless was much higher in East Sacunda than in West Sacunda, however, so we can conclude that building owners in East Sacunda were less likely to modify their buildings so as to bring them up to the 1985 code standards. ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter to the editor of an archaeological magazine. “Archaeologists excavated a cave that had been inhabited by prehistoric people for thousands of years. These people hunted wild animals, many of whose bones were found at levels corresponding to different times of habitation. Most of the bones at the oldest levels, over 40,000 years old, were from a deer species whose modern-day descendants are known to prefer woodland habitats, whereas most of the bones at more recent levels, dating from 30,000 to 10,000 years ago, were from a gazelle species whose modern-day descendants are known to prefer grasslands. We can thus conclude that the climate of the area changed dramatically between 40,000 and 30,000 years ago, causing the terrain to change from woodland to grassland.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a magazine for the trucking industry. “The Longhaul trucking company was concerned that its annual accident rate (the number of accidents per mile driven) was too high. It granted a significant pay increase to its drivers and increased its training standards. It also put strict limits on the number of hours per week each driver could drive. The following year, its trucks were involved in half the number of accidents as before the changes were implemented. A survey of other trucking companies found that the highest-paid drivers were the least likely to have had an accident. Therefore, trucking companies wishing to reduce their accident rate can do so simply by raising their drivers’ pay and limiting the overall number of hours they drive.” ——————————————— The following appeared as an editorial in a health magazine. “Clormium 5 is an odorless, tasteless, and generally harmless industrial by-product that can enter the water supply. A preliminary study has linked cooking with water containing clormium 5 to an increased incidence of allergies and skin rashes. Tests of the drinking water in several areas have revealed the presence of clormium 5. Although it is possible to remove clormium 5 from water, the costs of routine testing and purification are higher than many communities can afford. Therefore, in order to prevent allergies and skin rashes, communities that cannot afford to rid their drinking water of clormium 5 should replace drinking fountains in public buildings, such as schools and libraries, with bottled-water coolers.” ——————————————— Allergies are an overreaction of the immune system to certain stimuli. One view is that allergies can develop as the result of childhood exposure to certain irritants, such as dust or animal dander, while the immune system is not yet mature. Another view is that exposure to particular bacteria early in childhood actually triggers the proper development of the immune system, and that limiting exposure to these bacteria through excessive hygiene can cause children’s immune systems to overreact to certain irritants later on. A new study supports the second view: children who are washed especially frequently and whose parents clean their homes especially frequently are more likely to develop allergies than are other children. So in order to reduce the incidence of allergies in children and adults, parents should not limit children’s exposure to irritants or bacteria. ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter to an editor. “In many countries, wood is the primary fuel used for heating and cooking, but wood smoke can cause respiratory and eye problems, and extensive use of wood causes deforestation, a major environmental problem. In contrast, charcoal, made by partially burning wood in a controlled process, is a fuel that creates less smoke than wood does. Moreover, although charcoal costs slightly more than wood, less charcoal is needed to produce the same amount of heat. Therefore, people who use wood as their primary fuel can, without experiencing economic hardship, switch to charcoal and can thereby improve their health and preserve the environment.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the business manager of Medicine, Inc., a local drugstore. “Most business analysts for the drugstore industry have stated that even when a nation’s economy is weak, drugstores’ profits are unlikely to decline appreciably. While consumers might put off some kinds of purchases when the economy is slow, prescription and over-the-counter drug purchases are dictated by consumers’ health needs, which are independent of the economy. Therefore, Medicine Inc. is likely to continue to have increasing profits and should plan to open an additional drugstore next year.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo written by the head of the Gorham School. “Our school cafeteria should make changes in the lunches that it serves in order to improve the health of our students. Several teachers and I have observed that students who eat these meals tend to eat the main course and the dessert, but seldom finish the vegetable portion. This pattern means that students are missing the vital nutritional benefits of fruits and vegetables, which are typically rich in vitamins and minerals. Therefore, the school cafeteria should serve larger fruit and vegetable portions along with smaller main course and dessert portions. This change will be effective because, according to research conducted at the Rose Children’s Hospital, children eat the same amount of food served to them — about 55 percent, on average — no matter what the main course is.” ——————————————— The following appeared in the letter to an editor of a Myrian newspaper. “Under Governor Winslow’s leadership over the past four years, Myria has enjoyed unprecedented prosperity. Average wage increases this year are higher than they have been at any time since the 1970’s, the number of people who report being unemployed has decreased by 10 percent, and construction of new homes is up by one third. In contrast, over the past four years Governor Winslow’s opponent, Mr. Homer, has been mayor of a city in which only a small number of new businesses have opened. If Myrians want another four years like the past four years, they should reelect Governor Winslow.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from a member of the Clark City School Board. “Mason Elementary School is faced with a shortage of classroom space. At the same time, parents in our district are increasingly expressing the desire to see improvements in their children’s reading abilities. Therefore, we should reduce the number of physical education classes at Mason Elementary and convert part of the gymnasium to class-room space. The school will gain the additional space for classrooms without the cost of extending the building and can use the time that students would have spent in physical education classes to provide more reading instruction. This plan will lead to improvements in students’ reading skills.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo to managers of Christine’s, a chain of craft stores. “Several major newspapers have recently run articles noting an increased interest in pottery. The number of potters in this country has risen by eighteen percent in the past five years, and pottery is particularly gaining popularity on college campuses. In order to take advantage of these trends, Christine’s should immediately begin carrying a larger volume of pottery supplies. Since several of our stores have recently experienced a decrease in sales of painting supplies, all store managers should reallocate shelf space from the painting area for the display of pottery. Stores should display posters showing pottery that is designed to appeal to college-age individuals. These actions will undoubtedly increase our profits dramatically.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a newsletter about health published in the country of Sauria. “According to Sauria’s leading nutritional experts, a diet high in complex carbohydrates, and low in fat is optimal for good health and longevity. Because this was the diet of the people who lived in ancient Sauria, one would expect them to have had long and healthy lives. Yet the mummified remains of Sauria’s ruling classes from two to three thousand years ago show the existence of many medical problems among the ancient Saurians, including dental problems, elevated blood pressure, obesity, heart disease, and early mortality. Clearly, the diet of the ancient Saurians was responsible for these problems. The high incidence of high blood pressure, obesity, and heart disease in Sauria today even among those who have tried low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets further proves that Sauria’s leading nutritional experts are wrong.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a newspaper published in the state of Celera. “Speed limits on our state’s highways should be eliminated in order to increase our state’s prosperity. Because greater speed means more efficient travel, commercial deliveries will be faster, increasing business profits. Elimination of speed limits will also make driving more attractive to motorists, so that more people will use the highways, providing more highway toll revenues for the state. At the same time, safety on our highways will not be affected: daytime speed limits were eliminated last year in the western states of our country, and no significant increase in the number of accidents in these states has been reported.” ——————————————— The following appeared in an editorial on health problems in the country of Corpora. “Some pharmacies now feature ultrasound machines that screen for an elevated risk of stroke. For a fee, a technician presses a probe against the neck to determine whether any plaque has thickened the walls of the main artery leading to the brain. Researchers have shown that a thickening of artery walls is associated with elevated stroke risk, and such scans typically find that anywhere from 5 to 20 percent of clients have detectable plaque. All pharmacies should offer this service, because early detection of increased risk for stroke will encourage clients to consult with their doctors and make important life-style changes to reduce their risk of having a stroke. This in turn will cause a decrease in overall medical costs in Corpora.” ——————————————— The following appeared in an article in Supplements Today. “Dieticians have long known that professional athletes who eat a lot of nuts have higher levels of endurance than those who do not. Researchers have recently discovered that the particular combination of vitamin N and fiber found in some nuts provides a boost for those who participate in strenuous physical activities daily. Both vitamin N and fiber supplements are easily synthesized and widely available. As a result, all those who participate in athletic activities will be able to increase their endurance and win more games by taking vitamin N along with a fiber supplement.” ——————————————— The following is a recommendation from the human resources department at Techforce Computer Company. “Many working parents report that problems related to their childcare arrangements are a major reason for absenteeism from their jobs. Bridgewell Corporation, a tele-communications company, implemented an on-site childcare program and after one year, the company reported that unscheduled absences had declined by 25 percent. Since Techforce has had an increase in unscheduled employee absences over the past year, we should therefore implement our own on-site childcare program. The program will undoubtedly reduce our unscheduled employee absences, resulting in significantly increased productivity.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from a vice president of a large, highly diversified company. “Ten years ago our company had two new regional office buildings built in two different regions. The buildings were erected by two different construction companies — Alpha and Zeta. Even though the two buildings had virtually identical floor plans, the building constructed by Zeta cost 30 percent more to build, and its expenses for maintenance last year were twice those of the building constructed by Alpha. Furthermore, the energy consumption of the Zeta building has been higher than that of the Alpha building every year since its construction. Such data, plus the fact that Alpha has a stable workforce with little employee turnover, indicate that we should use Alpha Construction Company, rather than Zeta, for all future building projects.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the president of Bower Builders, a company that constructs new homes. “A nationwide survey reveals that the two most desired home features are a bathroom with a whirlpool tub and a large kitchen. Homes in a nearby development built by our competitor, Domus Construction, have whirlpool tubs and have sold much faster and at significantly higher prices than the average. To increase our sales and profits, we should include whirlpool tubs and larger kitchens as standard features in all our new homes. Since our recent buyers have voiced no complaints about small yards, we can also increase profits by decreasing the size of our yards.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from a budget planner in Sophia County. “Census data indicate that the number of retired couples without children who are moving into Sophia County is steadily rising; private schools in our county report substantial increases in enrollment; and a statewide survey of parents shows that over 10 percent now support the idea of home schooling instead of public schooling funded by the county government. Such demographic trends suggest that our county will not have to construct new school buildings and that we can therefore decrease the budget for county-funded public schools.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a magazine focusing on health and fitness. “A recent study of several nutritional supplements showed that subjects who took a daily pill containing luceen had significantly better vision of distant objects than subjects in the study who took other nutritional supplements. Luceen appears naturally in a tasty fruit that grows on the island of Bonopia, and very few inhabitants of that island wear eyeglasses or other corrective lenses. Such evidence suggests that people who develop vision problems should take regular luceen supplements.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the manager of television station KICK. “A nationwide survey reveals that a sizeable majority of men would like to see additional sports programs on television. After television station WACK increased its sports broadcasts, its share of the television audience in its viewing area almost doubled. To gain a larger audience share in our area, and thus increase company profits, KICK should also revise its broadcast schedule to include more sports coverage.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the director of a large group of hospitals. “In a laboratory study of liquid antibacterial hand soaps, a concentrated solution of Nadasept killed 40 percent more bacteria than the liquid hand soaps currently used in our hospitals. During a subsequent test of Nadasept at our hospital in Saluda, that hospital reported significantly fewer cases of patient infection than did any of the other hospitals in our group. Therefore, to prevent serious patient infections, we should supply Nadasept at all hand washing stations throughout our hospital system.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the economic minister of the small country Paucia. “Using a newly developed variety of seed, farmers in our neighboring country Abundia produced 80 percent more rice last year than in any previous year. To increase the income of farmers in our own country, we should encourage them to cultivate this new variety of rice rather than some of their traditional crops. Such high yields of rice will also improve our country’s balance of trade by enabling us to begin exporting it.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the chief operating officer of the Presto Manufacturing Company. “Since orders for our major product increased by over 200 percent last quarter, we should promptly expand production by building a new manufacturing plant in Summit City. Summit City is the ideal location for the new plant because it has low property taxes, extensive blocks of land available for immediate purchase, and a large number of residents who are not currently employed.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the president of a company that makes breakfast cereals. “In a recent study, subjects who ate soybeans at least five times per week had significantly lower cholesterol levels than subjects who ate no soy products. By fortifying our Wheat-O cereal with soy protein, we can increase sales by appealing to additional consumers who are concerned about their health. This new version of Wheat-O should increase company profits and, at the same time, improve the health of our customers.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter from the mayor of Tudor City. “After a major airline chose Yorkville as its regional flight hub, the number of businesses in that city almost doubled and local tax revenue increased by 50 percent. In addition, as travel to Yorkville became easier, most respondents to a survey of the country’s top executives identified Yorkville as a desirable place to transact business. To secure efficient transportation for Tudor City and stimulate our local economy, we should build a new airport, like the one in Yorkville, that is suitable for a regional flight hub.” ——————————————— Blue City Highway had always been notorious for its tight curves and poor roadway visibility, and the accident rate there was generally very high. Last year the highway was redesigned to broaden the curves and improve roadway visibility. Drivers report that they now feel much safer driving on the highway and that the redesign has been a big improvement. But the number of accidents on the highway has not been significantly lower in the six months since the redesign than it was in the six months before the redesign. Therefore, the redesign clearly did not improve the curves and roadway visibility enough to make a difference. ——————————————— One kind of brain-scanning device is used by doctors to monitor normal as well as abnormal activity in a patient’s brain. The device provides precise measurements of blood flow in the brain, a known indicator of how the brain is working. Unfortunately, the device requires patients to remain completely still with their heads in the scanning machine, which makes a very loud noise. Under these uncomfortable conditions, it is doubtful that doctors can get accurate measurements. A new head-mounted device that measures eye movements rather than blood flow and allows patients to move around will undoubtedly provide better brain measurements. Thus, the new head-mounted device should replace the older device at all hospitals and research institutions. ——————————————— The following appeared in a health newsletter. “According to a recent study, people with many social ties report catching colds less often than do people with few social ties. Consequently, researchers conclude that having an active social life probably helps strengthen the immune system. The researchers note that catching a cold — one of a family of highly contagious viruses — gives the cold-sufferer temporary immunity to that virus in the future, but not to the many other related viruses. Merely being exposed to a new cold virus, however, is not enough for a person to catch a cold, since a strong immune system can successfully fight off some new viruses. Thus, in order to prevent catching a cold, people should strengthen their immune systems by becoming more active socially.” ——————————————— The following editorial appeared in a newspaper in the country of Solaria. “The Eliot Valley region was primarily agricultural twenty years ago. In the past twenty years, however, many computer-chip manufacturers have opened factories there. A recent study found that water pollution in the region was worse than in any other region in the country. Moreover, the computer-chip factories, which use large quantities of water to manufacture the chips, are probably responsible for the low levels of water in the region’s lakes and reservoirs. Therefore, if the region’s computer-chip makers had limits placed on the amount of water they could use, water quality would improve.” ——————————————— The following appeared in an editorial in the Seatown newspaper. “Seatown has a large port exclusively for fishing boats, whose owners pay fees for the upkeep of the docks and for facilities for cleaning engines and repairing nets. In recent years, declining fish populations have decreased fishing revenue and forced many owners to stop fishing altogether. As a result, the port has a high vacancy rate and port managers are considering allowing pleasure boats, including cruise ships and other large vessels, to use the port in order to increase revenue. But allowing pleasure boats into the port would be a mistake, because the fishing boats would be forced out of the port. We should preserve the port for the fishing fleet, which, unlike pleasure boats, contributes to the prosperity of Seatown.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a Brenton newspaper. “The Brenton power plant draws water from Scott’s River for its cooling system and releases the warmed water back into the river. The town council recommends that the plant install a more efficient cooling system that uses less water, claiming it will be more environmentally sound. However, in Uptown, where the new system is used, a study found that the complex network of pipes in the new system tends to accumulate algae. The build up of algae can be avoided by scrubbing the pipes, which is costly, or by adding an herbicide to the water in the pipes to prevent algae accumulation. But water containing the herbicide cannot be released back into the river and it is known that low water levels can harm river ecosystems accustomed to higher levels. Therefore, Brenton power plant should continue to use the old cooling system exclusively.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter to the editor of the Maple City newspaper. “Twenty years ago Pine City established strict laws designed to limit the number of new buildings that could be constructed in the city. Since that time the average housing prices in Pine City have increased considerably. Chestnut City, which is about the same size as Pine City, has over the past twenty years experienced an increase in average housing prices similar to Pine City, but Chestnut City never established any laws that limit new building construction. So it is clear that laws limiting new construction have no effect on average housing prices. So if Maple City were to establish strict laws that limit new building construction, these laws will have no effect on average housing prices.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the Principal of Sherwood Junior High School. “It appears that the lighting in Sherwood High’s classrooms, which have large windows but minimal overhead light sources, is impairing student academic performance and teacher morale. Records show that during December and January, the two months with the fewest hours of daylight, attendance rates fall, average daily class participation drops, and grades decline. Teacher resignations are also highest during these months. According to a study of Tundra Vocational School, which experiences entire seasons with little daylight, students’ grade point averages increased when Day Glow light bulbs, which mimic sunlight, were installed in classrooms. This study suggests that Sherwood can improve students’ academic performance and teachers’ morale by using Day Glow light bulbs in winter.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from the vice president of marketing at Dura-Sock, Inc. “A recent study of Dura-Sock wearers suggests that our company is wasting the money it spends on its patented ‘Endure’ manufacturing process, which ensures that our socks are strong enough to last for two years. Dura-Sock has always advertised its use of the ‘Endure’ process, but the new study shows that the average Dura-Sock customer actually purchases new Dura-Socks every three months. Furthermore, Dura-Sock customers surveyed in our largest market, northeastern United States cities, say that they most value Dura-Sock’s stylish appearance and availability in many colors. These findings suggest that Dura-Sock can increase its profits by discontinuing its use of the ‘Endure’ manufacturing process.” ——————————————— The following proposal was raised at a meeting of the Franklin City Council. “Franklin Airport, which is on a bay, is notorious for flight delays. The airport management wants to build new runways to increase capacity but can only do so by filling in 900 acres of the bay. The Bay Coalition organization objects that filling in the bay will disrupt tidal patterns and harm wildlife. But the airport says that if it is permitted to build its new runways, it will fund the restoration of 1,000 acres of wetlands in areas of the bay that have previously been damaged by industrialization. This plan should be adopted, for it is necessary to reduce the flight delays, and the wetlands restoration part of the plan ensures that the bay’s environment will actually be helped rather than hurt.” ——————————————— The following was published by a consumer protection agency. “Three years ago, So-Low launched a nationwide ad campaign, focusing heavily on sunny regions and distributing free sunglasses there. But although So-Low sunglasses cost less than higher-priced brands, they block a smaller proportion of the Sun’s rays, including the type of rays known to damage the eyes even when the person wearing the sunglasses feels no discomfort. A recent study suggests that So-Low sunglasses can actually increase the risk of damage to people’s eyes by creating a false sense of security. The study shows a sharp increase in the incidence of vision problems in the sunny regions over the past three years. These findings suggest that anyone concerned about eye damage from the Sun should avoid So-Low brand and instead either pay for higher-priced brands or wear no sunglasses at all.” ——————————————— A recently completed study shows that people dwelling in stairs-only apartment buildings (that is, buildings without elevators) live an average of three years longer than do people who live in buildings with both elevators and stairs. A second study shows that elderly residents of buildings with elevators make, on average, twice as many visits to doctors each year as do elderly residents of buildings without elevators. These findings suggest that even a very moderate amount of daily exercise, such as that required to use the stairs leading to and from one’s apartment, can increase people’s health and longevity. The findings also suggest that new apartment buildings should be constructed with as few elevators as possible. ——————————————— The following appeared in a clothing industry trade journal in the country of Sartoria. “A popular fashion magazine recently conducted a survey of consumers’ opinions about clothing prices, using prepaid mailing envelopes. Eighty-nine percent of the approximately 20,000 respondents reported that they were either ‘dissatisfied’ or ‘very dissatisfied’ with current clothing prices. The large number of responses indicates that the Sartorian clothing industry is at risk. Given the survey results, clothing manufacturers must find a way to reduce prices in order to keep their existing customers and maintain their businesses.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a memo from Grocery Town’s regional manager. “The new Grocery Town store in Elm City, located near a new residential development, has a ‘high-low’ pricing policy where average prices are relatively high, but deep discounts are offered on some items in weekly specials. This store has been showing increased profits every month as the nearby residential development gets closer to full capacity. It follows that people prefer a pricing policy where they can find bargains on specific items. Since there is a new residential development planned in Oak City, we should change the pricing policy at all of our Oak City stores from our current ‘everyday low prices’ policy to a ‘high-low’ policy. This will increase the profits at all of our stores in Oak City.” ——————————————— The following is a memo from the business manager of Valu-Mart stores. “Over 70 percent of the respondents to a recent survey reported that they are required to take more work home with them from the workplace than they were in the past. Since Valu-Mart has not seen impressive sales in its office-supply departments in the past, we should take advantage of this work-at-home trend by increasing at all Valu-Mart stores the stock of home office machines such as printers, small copy machines, paper shredders, and fax machines. We will also increase stock of office supplies such as paper, pens, and staplers. With these changes, our office-supply departments will become the most profitable component of our stores.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a newsletter from a national astronomy association. “Various sources are predicting higher-than-average temperatures across the country next winter, including in Sun City, the traditional location of our yearly winter conference. Higher winter temperatures are sure to result in higher-than-usual tourism in Sun City, a location already known for its attractive beaches and good weather. Hotels will have fewer rooms available, transportation will be more difficult to reserve, and public places such as parks and restaurants will be more crowded. These conditions are likely to significantly reduce attendance at the conference. We should therefore move our conference to a city less popular with winter tourists.” ——————————————— The following is a letter to the editor of the Waymarsh Times. “Traffic problems here in Waymarsh are obviously reaching record levels. While just three months ago it would take me 15 minutes to get to work, it now takes closer to 25. Waymarsh should follow the example of our neighboring city Gearsville. Last year, Gearsville implemented a policy that rewards people who share rides to work with coupons for free gas. Pollution levels in Gearsville have dropped since the policy was implemented, and several friends who live in Gearsville tell me that their trip to work is quicker than it used to be. With the terrible traffic and high pollution in Waymarsh, we must implement a policy similar to Gearsville’s.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a health newsletter. “A ten-year nationwide study of the effectiveness of wearing a helmet while bicycling indicates that ten years ago, approximately 35 percent of all bicyclists reported wearing helmets, whereas today that number is nearly 80 percent. Another study, however, suggests that during the same ten-year period, the number of accidents caused by bicycling has increased 200 percent. These results demonstrate that bicyclists feel safer because they are wearing helmets and they take more risks as a result. Thus, to reduce the number of serious injuries from bicycle accidents, the government should concentrate more on educating people about bicycle safety and less on encouraging or requiring bicyclists to wear helmets.” ——————————————— The following is a memo from the president of Cyberell Computer Company. “All of our customer-service employees recently attended a two-day retreat during which they received retraining in effective customer service. Subsequently, Cyberell’s employee-performance study showed that the retreat benefited new employees — those who have worked with Cyberell for less than two years — far more than it did experienced employees. According to the study, after the retreat new employees were able to handle an average of ten percent more calls per hour, and the total number of customer complaints about new employees decreased, but experienced employees showed little improvement in these areas. Therefore, Cyberell should send only new employees to future retreats and should use the resulting savings to double the length of the retreats so that the retreats will be more likely to yield optimum employee performance.” ——————————————— The following appeared in the Pine City Gazette. “Fifteen years ago, Pine City launched an electricity-conservation program that reimbursed residents some of the cost for replacing energy-wasteful motors, home office equipment, and home appliances with energy-efficient ones. For ten years, spending on this program increased annually, and annual total energy consumption declined. But spending on the program began to decline five years ago, and since then Pine City’s total electricity consumption has increased sharply. If this increased usage continues, the city will have to build a costly new power plant. Obviously the best way to avoid this expense is to increase reimbursement to residents for replacing energy-wasteful equipment. This will reduce energy usage to the levels of five years ago.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a health newsletter. “Eating a heavy meal may increase the risk of heart attack. A recent survey of 2,000 people who had had a heart attack revealed that 158 of them said they had eaten a heavy meal within 24 hours before their heart attack, and 25 of them said they had eaten a heavy meal within 2 hours before their heart attack. Eating and digesting food releases hormones into the bloodstream and temporarily increases heart rate and blood pressure slightly. Both of these things put stress on the heart. Therefore, people who are at risk of having a heart attack can lower that risk by not overeating.” ——————————————— The following is a memo from the business manager of National Daily News. “To expand the home delivery service of our national newspaper, we should concentrate on the state of Urba rather than on the state of Sylva. First, the population of Sylva is more widely dispersed, which would require us to spend more money to deliver our papers in that area, resulting in less profit per customer. Second, a long-term study of television viewing habits suggests that Sylvans prefer local to national news, since they spend twice as much time viewing local news programs as they do viewing national programs. Finally, because events in Urba receive more coverage in our newspaper than do events in Sylva, we can expect Urbans to be more interested in reading our newspaper.” ——————————————— The following is a recommendation from the president of Appleby College. “Whereas Appleby College holds class reunions every five years, Edelston College holds annual reunions for all classes, during which Edelston’s alumni are treated to banquets, lectures, and student performances, enhancing their loyalty to the college and their willingness to donate money. Edelston College receives most of its alumni donations during or shortly after these reunions. Therefore, the best way for Appleby to increase its alumni donations is to offer similar reunion activities and to have each graduating class hold annual reunions.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a health magazine. “It has long been believed that getting at least eight hours of sleep a night is good for health. But a recent six-year study of adult sleeping habits found that people who reported sleeping eight or more hours a night had a higher rate of certain health problems than did those who reported sleeping seven hours a night. People who reported sleeping five hours a night also had an increased rate of the health problems, but this increase was slight compared to that for people who reported sleeping eight or more hours a night. Clearly, people should try to get seven hours of sleep, and they should worry more about getting too much sleep than too little.” ——————————————— The vice president for human resources at Climpson Industries sent the following recommendation to the company’s president. “In an effort to improve our employees’ productivity, we should implement electronic monitoring of employees’ Internet use from their workstations. Employees who use the Internet from their workstations need to be identified and punished if we are to reduce the number of work hours spent on personal or recreational activities, such as shopping or playing games. By installing software to detect employees’ Internet use on company computers, we can prevent employees from wasting time, foster a better work ethic at Climpson, and improve our overall profits.” ——————————————— The following appeared in an editorial in the Garden City Gazette. “To address the parking problems in our downtown business district, it has been proposed that the city increase parking capacity by building a four-story parking garage. However, this project would cost more than it would to improve the downtown pedestrian plaza. Because the pedestrian plaza is an important attraction that draws people to the downtown area, improvements to it will increase business for downtown merchants. The merchants’ higher profits will ultimately produce increased tax revenues for the city. Therefore, we should invest in the plaza improvements first and then use the revenues thus generated to pay for the construction of the parking garage.” ——————————————— The following appeared in the Sherwood Times newspaper. “A recent study reported that pet owners have longer, healthier lives on average than do people who own no pets. Specifically, dog owners tend to have a lower incidence of heart disease. In light of these findings, Sherwood Hospital should form a partnership with Sherwood Animal Shelter to institute an ‘adopt-a-dog’ program. The program would encourage dog ownership for patients recovering from heart disease, which will help reduce medical costs by reducing the number of these patients needing ongoing treatment. In addition, the publicity about the program will encourage more people to adopt pets from the shelter, which will reduce the risk of heart disease in the general population.” ——————————————— The following appeared in the annual report of a chain of stores that sell supplies for do-it-yourself home improvements. “Current reports indicate that sales of new homes nationwide declined by 9 percent during the past year, while sales of existing homes increased by 16 percent. Thus we can expect that the percentage of homeowners who will be making repairs or improvements to their homes will also increase. In addition, people who buy existing homes will have more money left over after the purchase to spend on home improvements. Finally, people who buy existing homes are more likely to make improvements themselves, as opposed to paying someone else. These factors combined indicate we can expect an increasing demand for products in all our stores nationwide, thus increasing our profits in the coming year.” ——————————————— The following appeared in an environmental newsletter published in Tria Island. “The marine sanctuary on Tria Island was established to protect certain marine mammals. Its regulations ban dumping and offshore oil drilling within 20 miles of Tria, but fishing is not banned. Currently many fish populations in Tria’s waters are declining, a situation blamed on pollution. In contrast, the marine sanctuary on Omni Island has regulations that ban dumping, offshore oil drilling, and fishing within 10 miles of Omni and Omni reports no significant decline in its fish populations. Clearly, the decline in fish populations in Tria’s waters is the result of overfishing, not pollution. Therefore, the best way to restore Tria’s fish populations and to protect all of Tria’s marine wildlife is to abandon our regulations and adopt those of Omni.” ——————————————— The following appeared in an editorial in the local newspaper of Workville. “Workers should be allowed to reduce their workload from 40 to 25 or even 20 hours per week because it is clear that people who work part-time instead of full-time have better health and improved morale. One store in Workville, which began allowing its employees to work part-time last year, reports that fewer days of sick leave were taken last year than in previous years. In contrast, the factory in Workville, which does not allow any of its employees to work part-time, had a slight increase in the number of days of sick leave taken last year. In addition, a recent survey reports that most of the store employees stated that they are satisfied with their jobs, while many of the factory employees stated that they are dissatisfied with their jobs.” ——————————————— The following is a memo from the principal of Academia High School. “Academia High School should abolish its after-school performing-arts programs and replace them with computer-technology programs. When nearby Techno High School did so last year, total enrollment in all of its after-school activities remained about the same. Moreover, on entering college, many Techno students chose a major directly related to their after-school activities. On the other hand, last year only 10 percent of Academia’s graduating seniors chose performing arts as their major field of study in their first year of college, clearly indicating that most students do not have a strong interest in the performing arts.” ——————————————— The following was taken from a guide for aspiring writers. “New writers usually cannot convince large, prestigious publishers that their work is marketable, so they must first publish with smaller, less well-known presses to establish a sales record. But the editors of Mystery Writers Magazine have good news for aspiring writers: the number of mystery novels published in the last two years has grown significantly, and more people read mysteries than any other type of novel. In addition, almost half of the mystery novels published last year were written by first-time novel writers. Since there is apparently an expanding market for mystery novels, all publishers will want to increase the number of mystery novels they publish. Therefore, new writers should write mystery novels to increase their chances for first-time publication with a larger, prestigious company.” ——————————————— The following is a memorandum from the business manager of WLSS television station. “Over the past year, our late-night news program has devoted increasingly more time to covering national news and less time to covering weather and local news. During the same time period, most of the complaints we received from viewers were concerned with the station’s coverage of weather and local news. In addition, several local businesses that used to run advertisements during our late-night news program have just cancelled their advertising contracts with us. Therefore, in order to attract more viewers to our news programs and to avoid losing any further advertising revenues, we should expand the coverage of weather and local news on all our news programs.” ——————————————— The following is part of a letter from the Brookfree School Board. “As part of our new educational reform program, we identified ten schools most in need of immediate improvement. An advisory committee is now recommending that we hire consultants to study further the schools’ problems and to propose a plan of action. Only two years ago, however, another group of consultants determined that several schools in our district had problems because their principals were inexperienced. Thus, if we want to see immediate improvement in our schools and save the district the money it would spend on hiring more consultants, we should replace all the principals in the ten worst schools with ten of our most experienced principals in the district.” ——————————————— The following appeared in an editorial in the Mason City newspaper. “At present, Mason City residents seldom use the nearby Mason River for any kind of recreational activity, even though surveys of the region’s residents consistently rank water sports (swimming, fishing, and boating) as a favorite form of recreation. Since there have been complaints about the quality of the water in the river, residents must be avoiding the river because they think that it is not clean enough. But that situation is about to change: the agency responsible for rivers in our region has announced plans to clean up Mason River. Therefore, recreational use of the river is likely to increase, so the Mason City council will need to increase its budget for improvements to the publicly owned lands along the Mason River.” ——————————————— The following report appeared in a memo from the vice president of the Southside Transportation Authority. “We should abandon our current five-year plan to purchase additional buses to serve the campus of Southside University, because students there are unlikely to use them. Consider the results of the recent campaign sponsored by the Environmental Club at Southside University: in a program on the campus radio station, the club asked students to call in and pledge that they would commute to school by bus instead of by automobile at least one day per week. Only ten percent of the students called in and pledged. In view of the campaign’s lack of success, we can assume that the bus service we currently offer will continue to be sufficient to serve the university.” ——————————————— The following appeared in the editorial section of an educational publication. “One study at Lee University found that first-semester grades of teenage students who had always attended public, tax-supported schools were slightly lower than the grades of students who had received some home schooling instruction by parents at home, although the grade differences disappeared in the second semester. These results suggest that home schooling is the best way to educate teenage children. Therefore, instead of spending more money on public education, the government should provide financial incentives so that home schooling is an option for more parents. After all, children schooled at home receive more attention, since they are taught by the best possible teacher: a parent who has a high stake in educating them well.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a report of the Committee on Faculty Promotions and Salaries at Elm City University. “During her 17 years as a professor of botany, Professor Thomas has proved herself to be well worth her annual salary of $50,000. Her classes are among the largest at the university, demonstrating her popularity among students. Moreover, the money she has brought to the university in research grants has exceeded her salary in each of the last two years. Therefore, in consideration of Professor Thomas’ demonstrated teaching and research abilities, we recommend that she receive a $10,000 raise and a promotion to Department Chairperson; without such a raise and promotion, we fear that Professor Thomas will leave Elm City University for another college.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a newsletter distributed at a recent political rally. “Over the past year, the Consolidated Copper Company (CCC) has purchased over one million square miles of land in the tropical nation of West Fredonia. Mining copper on this land will inevitably result in pollution and environmental disaster, since West Fredonia is home to several endangered animal species. But such disaster can be prevented if consumers simply refuse to purchase products that are made with CCC’s copper until the company abandons its mining plans.” ——————————————— The article entitled “Eating Iron” in last month’s issue of Eating for Health reported that a recent study found a correlation between high levels of iron in the diet and an increased risk of heart disease. Further, it is well established that there is a link between large amounts of red meat in the diet and heart disease, and red meat is high in iron. On the basis of the study and the well-established link between red meat and heart disease, we can conclude that the correlation between high iron levels and heart disease, then, is most probably a function of the correlation between red meat and heart disease. ——————————————— The following appeared as a letter to the editor of a national newspaper. “Your recent article on corporate downsizing* in the United States is misleading. The article gives the mistaken impression that many competent workers who lost jobs as a result of downsizing face serious economic hardship, often for years, before finding other suitable employment. But this impression is contradicted by a recent report on the United States economy, which found that since 1992 far more jobs have been created than have been eliminated. The report also demonstrates that many of those who lost their jobs have found new employment. Two-thirds of the newly created jobs have been in industries that tend to pay above-average wages, and the vast majority of these jobs are full-time.” *Downsizing is the process in which corporations deliberately reduce the number of their employees. ——————————————— According to a poll of 200 charitable organizations, donations of money to nonprofit groups increased by nearly 25 percent last year, though not all charities gained equally. Religious groups gained the most (30 percent), followed by environmental groups (23 percent), whereas educational institutions experienced only a very small increase in donations (3 percent). This poll indicates that more people are willing and able to give money to charities but that funding for education is not a priority for most people. These differences in donation rates must result from the perception that educational institutions are less in need of donations than are other kinds of institutions. ——————————————— A new study collected data that shows that people who snore are more likely to gain weight than are people who do not snore. It is well known that many people who snore also stop breathing frequently during the night for a few seconds, a condition called sleep apnea. The interruption of breathing wakes the person — often so briefly that the waking goes unnoticed — and can leave the person too tired during the day to exercise. Anyone who snores, therefore, should try to eat less than the average person and to exercise more. ——————————————— The following appeared in the editorial section of a local newspaper. “The librarians in our town’s school system have reported that the number of trips that our students make to their school library on a voluntary basis has decreased significantly in recent years. For example, the average seventh-grade student visited the school library five times last year, but four of those visits were part of required classroom activities. This shows that our students are reading less than in the past. To address this problem, our town needs to improve the atmosphere of the libraries so that they will be comfortable places in which to work. If students view the libraries as uncomfortable, then they are unlikely to want to spend much time there.” ——————————————— The following appeared in an editorial in a business magazine. “Although the sales of Whirlwind video games have declined over the past two years, a recent survey of video-game players suggests that this sales trend is about to be reversed. The survey asked video-game players what features they thought were most important in a video game. According to the survey, players prefer games that provide lifelike graphics, which require the most up-to-date computers. Whirlwind has just introduced several such games with an extensive advertising campaign directed at people 10 to 25 years old, the age-group most likely to play video games. It follows, then, that the sales of Whirlwind video games are likely to increase dramatically in the next few months.” ——————————————— The following appeared in the editorial section of Monroetown’s local newspaper. “Mayor Brown was recently re-elected by a clear majority of 52 percent of Monroetown’s voters. Her re-election, however, does not show that most people in our town favored Mayor Brown’s proposal for tax reduction over that of her opponent, Mr. Greene, who proposed raising taxes to improve education. It has been shown that voters nationwide tend to re-elect people already in office, regardless of candidates’ proposals. In fact, a local survey after the election showed most people in Monroetown disagreed with Mayor Brown’s proposal. Clearly most people in Monroetown favor improving education and therefore approve of Mr. Greene’s proposal despite the fact that they did not vote for him.” ——————————————— The following is a memorandum from the director of personnel to the president of Get-Away Airlines. “Since our mechanics are responsible for inspecting and maintaining our aircraft, Get-Away Airlines should pay to send them to the Quality-Care Seminar, a two-week seminar on proper maintenance procedures. I recommend this seminar because it is likely to be a wise investment, given that the automobile racing industry recently reported that the performance of its maintenance crews improved markedly after their crews had attended the seminar. These maintenance crews perform many of the same functions as do our mechanics, including refueling and repairing engines. The money we spend on sending our staff to the seminar will inevitably lead to improved maintenance and thus to greater customer satisfaction along with greater profits for our airline.” ——————————————— The following is a letter to the editor of an environmental magazine. “The decline in the numbers of amphibians worldwide clearly indicates the global pollution of water and air. Two studies of amphibians in YosemiteNational Park in California confirm my conclusion. In 1915 there were seven species of amphibians in the park, and there were abundant numbers of each species. However, in 1992 there were only four species of amphibians observed in the park, and the numbers of each species were drastically reduced. The decline in Yosemite has been blamed on the introduction of trout into the park’s waters, which began in 1920 (trout are known to eat amphibian eggs). But the introduction of trout cannot be the real reason for the Yosemite decline because it does not explain the worldwide decline.” ——————————————— The following is a letter to the editor of the Atticus City newspaper. “Former Mayor Durant owes an apology to the city of Atticus. Both the damage to the River Bridge, which connects Atticus to Hartley, and the traffic problems we have long experienced on the bridge were actually caused 20 years ago by Durant. After all, he is the one who approved the construction of the bridge. If he had approved a wider and better-designed bridge, on which approximately the same amount of public money would have been spent, none of the damage or problems would have occurred. Instead, the River Bridge has deteriorated far more rapidly over the past 20 years than has the much longer DerbyBridge up the river. Even though the winters have been severe in the past several years, this is no excuse for the negligence and wastefulness of Durant.” ——————————————— The following is a letter to the head of the tourism bureau on the island of Tria. “Erosion of beach sand along the shores of Tria Island is a serious threat to our island and our tourist industry. In order to stop the erosion, we should charge people for using the beaches. Although this solution may annoy a few tourists in the short term, it will reduce the number of people using the beaches and will raise money for replenishing the sand. Replenishing the sand, as was done to protect buildings on the nearby island of Batia, will help protect buildings along our shores, thereby reducing these buildings’ risk of additional damage from severe storms. And since the areas along the shore will be more attractive as a result, the beaches will be preserved and the area’s tourist industry will improve over the long term.” ——————————————— The following is from an editorial in the Midvale Observer, a local newspaper. “Ever since the 1950’s when television sets began to appear in the average home, the rate of crimes committed by teenagers in the country of Alta has steadily increased. This increase in teenage crime parallels the increase in violence shown on television. According to several national studies, even very young children who watch a great number of television shows featuring violent scenes display more violent behavior within their home environment than do children who do not watch violent shows. Furthermore, in a survey conducted by the Observer, over 90 percent of the respondents were parents who indicated that prime-time television — programs that are shown between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. — should show less violence. Therefore, in order to lower the rate of teenage crime in Alta, television viewers should demand that television programmers reduce the amount of violence shown during prime time.” ——————————————— The following appeared in the editorial section of a health and fitness magazine. “In a study of the effects of exercise on longevity, medical researchers tracked 500 middle-aged men over a 20-year period. The subjects represented a variety of occupations in several different parts of the country and responded to an annual survey in which they were asked: How often and how strenuously do you exercise? Of those who responded, the men who reported that they engaged in vigorous outdoor exercise nearly every day lived longer than the men who reported that they exercised mildly only once or twice a week. Given the clear link that this study establishes between longevity and exercise, doctors should not recommend moderate exercise to their patients but should instead encourage vigorous outdoor exercise on a daily basis.” ——————————————— The following appeared in a letter to the editor of a local newspaper. “Too much emphasis is placed on the development of reading skills in elementary school. Many students who are discouraged by the lonely activity of reading turn away from schoolwork merely because they are poor readers. But books recorded on audiocassette tape provide an important alternative for students at this crucial stage in their education, one the school board should not reject merely because of the expense involved. After all, many studies attest to the value of allowing students to hear books read aloud; there is even evidence that students whose parents read to them are even more likely to become able readers. Thus, hearing books on tape can only make students more eager to read and to learn. Therefore, the school board should encourage schools to buy books on tape and to use them in elementary education.” ——————————————— The following is taken from an advertisement placed in a weekly business magazine by the DickensAcademy. “We distributed a survey to senior management at International Mega-Publishing, Inc. The result of the survey clearly indicates that many employees were well prepared in business knowledge and computer skills, but lacked interpersonal skills to interact gracefully with customers. International Mega-Publishing decided to improve customer satisfaction by sending their newly hired employees to our one-day seminars. Since taking advantage of our program, International Mega-Publishing has seen a sharp increase in sales, an indication that the number of their disgruntled customers has declined significantly. Your company should hire Dickens and let us turn every employee into an ambassador for your company.” ——————————————— The following is a letter to the editor of a local newspaper. “As a local merchant, I wish to support the development of a ski resort in the state park north of our township. Along with many other merchants who favor the proposal by Ski the Slopes, Incorporated, I would, of course, experience a growth in my business. But I also know how much more prosperous, not to mention lively and interesting, our community would be if tourism increased. Since the main opposition comes from a few environmentalists* who do not even live in this community, I see no reason to give in to their views. The First National Bank has finally researched the project and agreed to fund it. As a result, I see no reason to delay development of the resort.” Environmentalists are people who advocate the preservation of the natural environment. ——————————————— The Trash-Site Safety Council has recently conducted a statewide study of possible harmful effects of garbage sites on the health of people living near the sites. A total of five sites and 300 people were examined. The study revealed, on average, only a small statistical correlation between the proximity of homes to garbage sites and the incidence of unexplained rashes among people living in these homes. Furthermore, although it is true that people living near the largest trash sites had a slightly higher incidence of the rashes, there was otherwise no correlation between the size of the garbage sites and people’s health. Therefore, the council is pleased to announce that the current system of garbage sites does not pose a significant health hazard. We see no need to restrict the size of such sites in our state or to place any restrictions on the number of homes built near the sites. ——————————————— The nation of Claria covers a vast physical area. But despite wide geographic differences, many citizens are experiencing rising costs of electricity. A recent study of household electric costs in Claria found that families who cooled their houses with fans alone spent more on electricity than did families using air conditioners alone for cooling. However, those households that reported using both fans and air conditioners spent less on electricity than those households that used either fans or air conditioners alone. Thus, the citizens of Claria should follow the study’s recommendation and use both air conditioners and fans in order to save money on electricity. ——————————————— As people grow older, an enzyme known as PEP increasingly breaks down the neuropeptide chemicals involved in learning and memory. But now, researchers have found compounds that prevent PEP from breaking neuropeptides apart. In tests, these compounds almost completely restored lost memory in rats. The use of these compounds should be extended to students who have poor memory and difficulty in concentrating — and therefore serious problems in school performance. Science finally has a solution for problems neither parents nor teachers could solve. ——————————————— In a study of reading habits of Leeville citizens conducted by the University of Leeville, most respondents said they preferred literary classics as reading material. However, a follow-up study conducted by the same researchers found that the type of book most frequently checked out of each of the public libraries in Leeville was the mystery novel. Therefore, it can be concluded that the respondents in the first study had misrepresented their reading habits."},{"title":"Flight Reservation Generator","date":"2024-10-11T22:00:00.000Z","updated":"2024-10-12T19:33:54.426Z","comments":true,"path":"pdfcreate/index.html","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/pdfcreate/index.html","excerpt":"","text":"Flight Reservation Generator body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 20px; } input, select { margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 8px; width: 100%; } button { padding: 10px; background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; border: none; cursor: pointer; } button:hover { background-color: #45a049; } #reservation { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6; color: #333; margin-top: 20px; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; } #downloadButton { display: none; } Flight Reservation Generator Name: Passport Number: Nationality: Date of Birth: Departure Date: Return Date: Generate Reservation Download Reservation as PDF document.getElementById('reservationForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); const name = document.getElementById('name').value; const passport = document.getElementById('passport').value; const nationality = document.getElementById('nationality').value; const dob = document.getElementById('dob').value; const departureDate = document.getElementById('departureDate').value; const returnDate = document.getElementById('returnDate').value; const reservationText = ` Booking Reference: ABC123456 Passenger Details: - Name: ${name} - Passport Number: ${passport} - Nationality: ${nationality} - Date of Birth: ${dob} Flight Itinerary: Departure: - Date: ${departureDate} Return: - Date: ${returnDate} Class of Service: Economy Total Fare: $500.00 Contact Information: - Email: support@ilyfei.com - Phone: (0521) 1453-4546 ------------------------------- Important Notes ------------------------------- Please arrive at the airport at least 3 hours prior to departure.

We encourage all students to volunteer for at least one community activity before they graduate. A new community program called “One On One” helps elementary students who’ve fallen behind. You education majors might be especially interested in it because it offers the opportunity to do some teaching—that is, tutoring in math and English. You’d have to volunteer two hours a week for one semester. You can choose to help a child with math, English, or both. Half-hour lessons are fine, so you could do a half hour of each subject two days a week. Professor Dodge will act as a mentor to the tutors—he’ll be available to help you with lesson plans or to offer suggestions for activities. He has office hours every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon. You can sign up for the program with him and begin the tutoring next week. I’m sure you’ll enjoy this community service and you’ll gain valuable experience at the same time. It looks good on your resume, too, showing that you’ve had experience with children and that you care about your community. If you’d like to sign up, or if you have any questions, stop by Professor Dodge’s office this week. 2I hope you’ve all finished reading the assigned chapter on insurance so that you’re prepared for our discussion today. But, before we start, I’d like to mention a few things your text doesn’t go into. It’s interesting to note that insurance has existed in some form for a very long time. The earliest insurance policies were what we are called bottomry（use boats as mortgage） contracts. They provided shipping protection for merchants as far back as 3000 B.C. In general, the contracts were often no more than verbal agreements. They granted loans to merchants with the understanding that if a particular shipment of goods was lost at sea, the loan didn’t have to be repaid. Interest on the loans varied according to how risky it was to transport the goods. During periods of heavy piracy at sea, for example, the amount of interest and the cost of the policy went up considerably. So, you can see how insurance helped encourage international trade. Even the most cautious merchants became willing to risk shipping their goods over long distances, not to mention in hazardous weather conditions when they had this kind of protection available. Generally speaking, the basic form of an insurance policy has been pretty much the same since the Middle Ages. There are four points that were salient then and remain paramount in all policies today. These were outlined in chapter six and will serve as the basis for the rest of today’s discussion. Can anyone tell me what one of those points might be? 3Located at the NASA Research Center in Iowa is a 5,000-gallon vat of water, and inside the tank is an underwater treadmill designed by Dava Newman, an aerospace engineer. For four years Newman observed scuba divers as they simulated walking on the Moon and on Mars on her underwater moving belt. She wanted to discover how the gravity of the Moon and of Mars would affect human movement. To do this, Newman attached weights to the divers and then lowered them into the tank and onto the treadmill. These weights were carefully adjusted so that the divers could experience underwater the gravity of the Moon and of Mars as they walked on the treadmill. Newman concluded that walking on Mars will probably be easier than walking on the Moon. The Moon has less gravity than Mars does, so at lunar gravity, the divers struggled to keep their balance and walked awkwardly. But at Martian gravity, the divers had greater traction and stability and could easily adjust to a pace of 1.5 miles per hour. As Newman gradually increased the speed of the treadmill, the divers took longer, graceful strides until they comfortably settled into an even quicker pace. Newman also noted that at Martian gravity, the divers needed less oxygen. The data Newman collected will help in the future design of Martian space suits. Compared to lunar space suits, Martian space suits will require smaller air tanks; and, to allow for freer movement, the elbow and knee areas of the space suits will also be altered. 4Welcome to Everglades National Park. The Everglades is a watery plain covered with saw grass that’s home to numerous species of plants and wildlife. At one and a half million acres, it’s too big to see it all today, but this tour will offer you a good sampling. Our tour bus will stop first at Taylor Slough. This is a good place to start because it’s home to many of the plants and animals typically associated with the Everglades. You’ll see many exotic birds and, of course, our world famous alligators. Don’t worry, there’s a boardwalk that goes across the marsh, so you can look down at the animals in the water from a safe distance. The boardwalk is high enough to give you a great view of the saw grass prairie. From there we’ll head to some other marshy and even jungle like areas that feature wonderful tropical plant life. For those of you who’d like a closer view of the saw grass prairie, you might consider renting a canoe sometime during your visit here. However, don’t do this unless you have a very good sense of direction and can negotiate your way through tall grass. We’d hate to have to come looking for you. You have the good fortune of being here in the winter—the best time of year to visit. During the spring and summer, the mosquitoes will just about eat you alive! Right now they’re not so bothersome, but you’ll still want to use an insect repellent. 5Thank you. It’s great to see so many of you interested in this series on “Survival in Outer Space.” Please excuse the cameras, we’re being videotaped for the local TV stations. Tonight I’m going to talk about the most basic aspect of survival—the space suit. When most of you imagine an astronaut, that’s probably the fist thing that comes to mind, right? Well, without space suits, it would not be possible for us to survive in space. For example, outer space is a vacuum—there’s no gravity or air pressure; without protection, a body would explode. What’s more, we’d cook in the sun or freeze in the shade with temperatures ranging from a toasty 300 degrees above to a cool 300 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. The space suit that NASA has developed is truly a marvel. This photo enlargement here is a life-size image of an actual space suit worn by astronauts on the last space shuttle mission. This part is the torso. It’s made of seven extremely durable layers. This thick insulation protects against temperature extremes and radiation. Next is what they call a “bladder” of oxygen that’s an inflatable sac, filled with oxygen, to simulate atmospheric pressure. This bladder presses against the body with the same force as the Earth’s atmosphere at sea level. The innermost layers provide liquid cooling and ventilation. Despite all the layers, the suit is flexible, allowing free movement so we can work. Another really sophisticated part of the space suit is the helmet. I brought one along to show you. Can I have a volunteer come and demonstrate? 6Good evening. My name is Pam Jones, and on behalf of the Modern Dance club, I’d like to welcome you to tonight’s program. The club is pleased to present the TV version of The Catherine Wheel, Twyla Tharp’s rock ballet. This video version of the ballet has been even more successful with audiences than the original theater production. It includes some animation, slow motion, and stop-action freezes that really help the audience understand the dance. The title of the piece refers to Saint Catherine, who died on a wheel in 307 A.D. Nowadays, a Catherine wheel is also a kind of firework. It looks something like a pinwheel. Anyway, the dance is certainly full of fireworks! You’ll see how Twyla Tharp explores one family’s attempt to confront the violence in modern life. The central symbol of the work is a pineapple, but exactly what it represents has always created a lot of controversy. As you watch, see if you can figure it out. The music for this piece is full of the rhythmic energy of rock music. It was composed by David Byrne. Of the rock band Talking Heads? And the lead dancer in this version was Sara Rudner, who is perfectly suited to Tharp’s adventurous choreography. Following the video, dance teacher Mary Parker will lead a discussion about the symbolism Ms. Tharp used. We hope you can stay for that. So, enjoy tonight’s video and thank you for your support. 7In our lab today, we’ll be testing the hypothesis that babies can count as early as five months of age. The six babies here are all less than six months old. You’ll be watching them on closed-circuit TV and measuring their responses. The experiment is based on the well-established observation that babies stare longer if they don’t see what they expect to see. First, we’re going to let two dolls move slowly in front of the babies. The babies will see the two dolls disappear behind a screen. Your job is to record, in seconds, how long the babies stare at the dolls when the screen is removed. In the next stage, two dolls will again move in front of the babies and disappear. But then a third doll will follow. When the screen is removed, the babies will only see two dolls. If we’re right, the babies will now stare longer because they expect three dolls but only see two. It seems remarkable to think that such young children can count. My own research has convinced me that they have this ability from birth. But whether they do or not, perhaps we should raise another question. Should we take advantage of this ability by teaching children mathematics at such a young age? They have great untapped potential, but is it good for parents to pressure young children? 8Before starting our tour of Monticello, I’d like to give you some historical facts that might help you appreciate what you see today even more. Monticello was the very much loved home of Thomas Jefferson for over fifty years. Jefferson, who was, of course, President, was also a great reader and language enthusiast. He read widely on different subjects, including architecture. He wasn’t formally trained in architecture, but as a result of his study and observation of other buildings, he was able to help design and build the house. He chose the site himself, naming the estate “Monticello,” which means “little mountain” in Italian. In fact, many of the ideas behind the design also came from the Italian architect Andrea Palladio, who lived in the sixteenth century and who had a great influence on the architecture of England. Jefferson, however, ignored one of Palladio’s principles, that is, not to build in a high place. Monticello’s elevation made the transportation of what was needed at the house—for example, food—especially difficult. But the view from the estate would not be as spectacular if Jefferson had followed Palladio’s advice; there really is no boundary between the house and the nature around it, and so Jefferson was able to look out on his beloved state of Virginia from his wonderful vantage point. Now we’ll go on to Jefferson’s library. 9Now that we’ve all introduced ourselves to the new members, let’s get down to work. As the committee in charge of this year’s tree-planting project, we have several items on our agenda. First, we have to review the budget. The president has informed me that the trustees have set aside $3,000 for the purchase of trees and our environmental T-shirt sale netted a profit of $1,500. Second, we have to finalize the choice of trees. As you know, we’re working with Richardson’s Nursery again this year since everyone seemed pleased with the work he did for us last year. Mr. Richardson has presented us with several choices within our price range that he thinks would meet our needs. He’s sent us pictures of the trees for us to look at, but he wanted me to tell you that we’re welcome to visit the nursery if we want to see the trees themselves. Lastly, we need to plan some kind of ceremony to commemorate the planting. Several ideas, including a garden party of some sort, have been suggested. So let’s get on with it and turn to the first order of business. 10Welcome to the Four Winds Historical Farm, where traditions of the past are preserved for visitors like you. Today, our master thatchers will begin giving this barn behind me a sturdy thatched roof, able to withstand heavy winds and last up to a hundred years. How do they do it? Well, in a nutshell, thatching involves covering the beams or rafters, the wooden skeleton of a roof with reeds or straw. Our thatchers here have harvested their own natural materials for the job, the bundles of water reeds you see lying over there beside the barn. Thatching is certainly uncommon in the Untied States today. I guess that’s why so many of you have come to see this demonstration. But it wasn’t always that way. In the seventeenth century, the colonists here thatched their roofs with reeds and straw, just as they had done in England. After a while, though, they began to replace the thatch with wooden shingles because wood was so plentiful. And eventually, other roofing materials like stone, slate, and clay tiles came into use. It’s a real shame that most people today don’t realize how strong and long lasting a thatched roof is. In Ireland, where thatching is still practiced, the roofs can survive winds of up to one hundred ten miles per hour. That’s because straw and reeds are so flexible. They bend but don’t break in the wind like other materials can. Another advantage is that the roofs keep the house cool in the summer and warm in the winter. And then, of course, there’s the roofs’ longevity—the average is sixty years, but they can last up to a hundred. With all these reasons to start thatching roofs again, wouldn’t it be wonderful to see this disappearing craft return to popularity? 11A lot of people in the United States are coffee drinkers. Over the last few years, a trend has been developing to introduce premium, specially blended coffees, known as “gourmet coffees” into the American market. Boston seems to have been the birthplace of this trend. In fact, major gourmet coffee merchants from other cities like Seattle and San Francisco came to Boston, where today they’re engaged in a kind of “coffee war” with Boston’s merchants. They are all competing for a significant share of the gourmet coffee market. Surprisingly, the competition among these leading gourmet coffee businesses will not hurt any of them. Experts predict that the gourmet coffee market in the United States is growing and will continue to grow, to the point that gourmet coffee will soon capture half of what is now a 1.5-million-dollar market and will be an 8-million-dollar market by 1999. Studies have shown that coffee drinkers who convert to gourmet coffee seldom go back to the regular brands found in supermarkets. As a result, these brands will be the real losers in the gourmet coffee competition. 12You may remember that a few weeks ago we discussed the question of what photography is. Is it art, or is it a method of reproducing images? Do photographs belong in museums or just in our homes? Today I want to talk about a person who tried to make his professional life an answer to such questions. Alfred Stieglitz went from the United States to Germany to study engineering. While he was there, he became interested in photography and began to experiment with his camera. He took pictures under conditions that most photographers considered too difficult. He took them at night, in the rain, and of people and objects reflected in windows. When he returned to the United States he continued these revolutionary efforts. Stieglitz was the first person to photograph skyscrapers, clouds, and views from an airplane. What Stieglitz was trying to do in these photographs was what he tried to do throughout his life: make photography an art. He felt that photography could be just as good a form of self-expression as painting or drawing. For Stieglitz, his camera was his brush. While many photographers of the late 1800’s and early 1900’s thought of their work as a reproduction of identical images, Stieglitz saw his as a creative art form.He understood the power of the camera to capture the moment. In fact, he never retouched his prints or made copies of them. If he were in this classroom today, I’m sure he’d say, “Well, painters don’t normally make extra copies of their paintings, do they?” 13So, uh . . . as Jim said, James Polk was the eleventh President, and . . . uh . . . well, my report’s about the next President—Zachary Taylor. Taylor was elected in 1849. It’s surprising because . . . well, he was the first President that didn’t have any previous political experience. The main reason he was chosen as a candidate was because he was a war hero. In the army, his men called him “Old Rough and Ready”. I guess because of his . . . “rough edges.” He was kind of blunt and he didn’t really look like a military hero. He liked to do things like wear civilian clothes instead of a uniform, even in battle. And he was so short and plump he had to be lifted up onto his horse. But he did win a lot of battles and he became more and more popular. So, the Whig party decided to nominate him for the presidency, even though no one knew anything about where he stood on the issues. I couldn’t find much about his accomplishments, probably because he was only in office about a year and a half before he died. But one thing, he pushed for the development of the transcontinental railroad because he thought it was important to form a link with the West Coast. There was a lot of wealth in California and Oregon from commerce and minerals and stuff. Also, he established an agricultural bureau in the Department of the Interior and promoted more government aid to agriculture. Well, that’s about all I found. Like I said, he died in office in 1850, so his Vice President took over, and that’s the next report, so . . . thank you. 14I want to welcome each and every balloon enthusiast to Philadelphia. Thank you for coming here this morning to commemorate the first balloon voyage in the United States. On January 9, 1793, at ten o’clock in the morning, a silk balloon lifted into the skies above this city, which was, at the time, the capital of the country. According to the original records of the flight, the voyage lasted forty-six minutes, from its departure in Philadelphia to its landing across the Delaware River in New Jersey. Though our pilots today will try to approximate the original landing site, they’re at the mercy of the winds, so who knows where they’ll drift off to. Even the balloonist in 1793 experienced some uncertain weather that day. There were clouds, fog, and mist in various directions. Our reenactment promises to be nothing less than spectacular. The yellow balloon directly behind me is five stories high. It’s inflated with helium, unlike the original, which was filled with hydrogen and, unbeknownst to the pilot, potentially explosive. Gas-filled models are pretty uncommon now because of the extremely high cost, so the eighty other balloons in today’s launch are hot air, heated by propane burners. These balloons are from all over the country. 15I’m glad you brought up the question of our investigations into the makeup of the Earth’s interior. In fact, since this is the topic of your reading assignment for next time, let me spend these last few minutes of class talking about it. There were several important discoveries in the early part of this century that helped geologists develop a more accurate picture of the Earth’s interior. The first key discovery had to do with seismic waves. Remember they are the vibrations caused by earthquakes. Well, scientists found that they traveled thousands of miles through the Earth’s interior. This finding enabled geologists to study the inner parts of the Earth. You see, these studies revealed that these vibrations were of two types: compression or P waves and shear or S waves. And researchers found that P waves travel through both liquids and solids, while S waves travel only through solid matter. In 1906, a British geologist discovered that P waves slowed down at a certain depth but kept traveling deeper. On the other hand, S waves either disappeared or were reflected back, so he concluded that the depth marked the boundary between a solid mantle and a liquid core. Three years later, another boundary was discovered that between the mantle and the Earth’s crust. There’s still a lot to be learned about the Earth. For instance, geologists know that the core is hot. Evidence of this is the molten lava that flows out of volcanoes. But we’re still not sure what the source of the heat is. 16Today we’re going to practice evaluating the main tool used when addressing groups—the voice. There are three main elements that combine to create either a positive or negative experience for listeners. They can result in a voice that is pleasing to listen to and can be used effectively. Or they can create a voice that doesn’t hold attention, or even worse, causes an adverse reaction. The three elements are volume, pitch, and pace. When evaluating volume, keep in mind that a good speaker will adjust to the size of both the room and the audience. Of course, with an amplifying device like a microphone, the speaker can use a natural tone. But speakers should not be dependent on microphones; a good speaker can speak loudly without shouting. The second element, pitch, is related to the highness or lowness of the sounds. High pitches are, for most people, more difficult to listen to, so in general speakers should use the lower registers of their voice. During a presentation, it’s important to vary pitch to some extent in order to maintain interest. The third element, pace, that is how fast or slow words and sounds are articulated, should also be varied. A slower pace can be used to emphasize important points. Note that the time spent not speaking can be meaningful, too. Pauses ought to be used to signal transitions or create anticipation. Because a pause gives the listeners time to think about what was just said or even to predict what might come next, it can be very effective when moving from one topic to another. What I’d like you to do now is watch and listen to a videotape and use the forms I gave you to rate the speaking voices you hear. Then tonight I want you to go home and read a passage into a tape recorder and evaluate your own voice. 17Let’s proceed to the main exhibit hall and look at some of the actual vehicles that have played a prominent role in speeding up mail delivery. Consider how long it used to take to send a letter across a relatively short distance. Back in the 1600’s it took two weeks on horseback to get a letter from Boston to New York, a distance of about 260 miles. Crossing a river was also a challenge. Ferry service was so irregular that a carrier would sometimes wait hours just to catch a ferry. For journeys inland, there was always the stagecoach, but the ride was by no means comfortable because it had to be shared with other passengers. The post office was pretty ingenious about some routes. In the nineteenth century, in the Southwestern desert, for instance, camels were brought in to help get the mail through. In Alaska, reindeer were used. This practice was discontinued because of the disagreeable temperament of these animals. We’ll stop here a minute so that you can enter this replica of a railway mail car. It was during the Age of the Iron Horse that delivery really started to pick up, in fact, the United States transported most bulk mail by train for nearly 100 years. The first airmail service didn’t start until 1918. Please take a few moments to look around. I hope you’ll enjoy your tour. And as you continue on your own, may I suggest you visit our impressive philatelic collection. Not only can you look at some of the more unusual stamps issues, but there is an interesting exhibit on how stamps are made. 18Most people think of astronomers as people who spend their time in cold observatories peering through telescopes every night. In fact, a typical astronomer spends most of his or her time analyzing data and may only be at the telescope a few weeks of the year. Some astronomers work on purely theoretical problems and never use a telescope at all. You might not know how rarely images are viewed directly through telescopes. The most common way to observe the skies is to photograph them. The process is very simple. First, a photographic plate is coated with a light-sensitive material. The plate is positioned so that the image received by the telescope is recorded on it. Then the image can be developed, enlarged, and published so that many people can study it. Because most astronomical objects are very remote, the light we receive from them is rather feeble. But by using a telescope as a camera, long time exposures can be made. In this way, objects can be photographed that are a hundred times too faint to be seen by just looking through a telescope. 19Before we start our first lab, I’d like to tell you a little bit about the workbook we’ll be using. The first thing I’d like to point out is that the workbook contains a very large amount of material, far more than you could ever handle in a single semester. What you’re supposed to do is choose the experiments and activities that you want to do—within a certain framework, of course. Part of my job is to help you make your choices. Next, I’d like to mention that in each workbook chapter, there are usually two subsections. The first is called “Experiments” and the second is called “Activities.” In the “Experiments” section, the workbook gives full instructions for all the experiments, including alternate procedures. Choose the procedure you wish—there’s plenty of equipment available. In the “Activities” section, you will find suggestions for projects that you can do on your own time. You’ll see that there are usually no detailed instructions for the activities—you’re supposed to do them your own way. If there are no questions, let’s turn to Chapter One now. 20Do you have trouble sleeping at night? Then maybe this is for you. When you worry about needing sleep and toss and turn trying to find a comfortable position, you’re probably only making matters worse. What happens when you do that, is that your heart rate actually increases, making it more difficult to relax. You may also have some bad habits that contribute to the problem. Do you rest frequently during the day? Do you get virtually no exercise, or do you exercise strenuously late in the day? Are you preoccupied with sleep, or do you sleep late on weekends? Any or all of these factors might be leading to your insomnia by disrupting your body’s natural rhythm. What should you do, then, on those sleepless nights? Don’t bother with sleeping pills. They can actually cause worse insomnia later. The best thing to do is drink milk or eat cheese or tuna fish. These are all rich in amino acids and help produce a neurotransmitter in the brain that induces sleep. This neurotransmitter will help you relax, and you’ll be on your way to getting a good night’s sleep. Until tomorrow’s broadcast, this has been another in the series “Hints for Good Health.” 21Today we’ll examine the role that private transportation, namely, the automobile plays in city planning. A number of sociologists blame the automobile for the decline of the downtown areas of major cities. In the 1950’s and 1960’s the automobile made it possible to work in the city and yet live in the suburbs many miles away. Shopping patterns changed: instead of patronizing downtown stores, people in the suburbs went to large shopping malls outside the city and closer to home. Merchants in the city failed; and their stores closed. Downtown shopping areas became deserted. In recent years there’s been a rebirth of the downtown areas, as many suburbanites have moved back to the city. They’ve done this, of course, to avoid highways clogged with commuters from the suburbs. I’ve chosen this particular city planning problem—our dependence on private transportation to discuss in groups. I’m hoping you all will come up with some innovative solutions. Oh, and don’t approach the problem from a purely sociological perspective; try to take into account environmental and economic issues as well. 22Word comes from California of a new weapon in the war on household pests. Two scientists working for a firm in Anaheim, California, have developed a method to eliminate insects without using dangerous chemicals. The new poison? Hot air. The basic idea is that insects cannot adjust to temperatures much above normal. In laboratory experiments, cockroaches and termites can’t survive much more than a quarter of an hour at 125 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 50 degrees centigrade. The new method involves covering a house with a huge tent and filling it with air heated to around 65 degrees centigrade. Hot air is forced in with fans, and the tent keeps the heat inside the house. Since termites try to escape by hiding in wooden beams, the heat treatment must be continued for a full six hours. But when it’s all over, and the insects are dead, there are no toxic residues to endanger humans or pets, and no funny smells. Scientists claim that there is no danger of fire, either, since very few household materials will burn at 65 degrees centigrade. In fact, wood is prepared for construction use by drying it in ovens at 80 degree centigrade, which is substantially hotter than the air used in this procedure. 23I’m sure you realize that your research papers are due in six weeks. I’ve looked at your proposed topics and made comments about them. The most frequent problem was proposing too broad a topic. Remember, this is only a fifteen-page paper. As I return your topic papers, I’d like to look over the schedule which sketches out what we’ll do during the next two weeks. Today is Monday; by Friday, I want your preliminary outline. Please be sure to incorporate the suggestions I’ve made on your topics in your outlines. Next week I’ll have a conference with each of you. I’ve posted a schedule on my office door. Sign your name to indicate the time you’re available for an appointment. In the conference, we’ll discuss your preliminary outline. Then you can make the necessary revisions and hand in your final outline, which is due two weeks from today. Use the outline style in your textbook and remember it should be no more than two pages long. Be sure to begin with a thesis statement, that is, with a precise statement of the point you intend to prove and include a conclusion. Have you got all that? Your two-page preliminary outlines are due at the end of this week and the final outlines are due after your conferences. Follow the textbook style and include a thesis statement and a conclusion. 24Before we begin our tour, I’d like to give you some background information on the painter Grant Wood. We’ll be seeing much of his work today. Wood was born in 1881 in Iowa farm country, and became interested in art very early in life. Although he studied art in both Minneapolis and at the Art Institute of Chicago, the strongest influences on his art were European. He spent time in both Germany and France and his study there helped shape his own stylized form of realism. When he returned to Iowa, Wood applied the stylistic realism he had learned in Europe to the rural life he saw around him and that he remembered from his childhood around the turn of the century. His portraits of farm families imitate the static formalism of photographs of early settlers posed in front of their homes. His paintings of farmers at work, and of their tools and animals, demonstrate a serious respect for the life of the Midwestern United States. By the 1930’s, Wood was a leading figure of the school of art called “American regionalism.” In an effort to sustain a strong Midwestern artistic movement, Wood established an institute of Midwestern art in his home state. Although the institute failed, the paintings you are about to see preserve Wood’s vision of pioneer farmers. 25In today’s class we’ll be examining some nineteenth-century pattern books that were used for building houses. I think it’s fair to say that these pattern books were the most important influence on the design of North American houses during the nineteenth century. This was because most people who wanted to build a house couldn’t afford to hire an architect. Instead, they bought a pattern book, picked out a plan, and took it to the builder. The difference in cost was substantial. In 1870, for example, hiring an architect would’ve cost about a hundred dollars. At the same time, a pattern book written by an architect cost only five dollars. At that price, it’s easy to see why pattern books were so popular. Some are back in print again today, and of course they cost a lot more than they did a hundred years ago. But they’re an invaluable resource for historians, and also for people who restore old houses. I have a modern reprint here that I’ll be passing around the room in a moment so that everyone can have a look. 26When I was in British Columbia last July working at the department’s archaeological dig, I saw the weirdest rainbow. At first I couldn’t believe my eyes because the bands of color I saw weren’t in a single half circle arc across the sky. Instead, I saw a full circle of rainbow hues hanging in the sky just above the sea. Inside the circle there was a big white disc and above the circle there was another round band of colors forming a halo. There were curved legs of multicolored light coming off the sides of the circles. It was an incredible sight. I ran back to our main camp and tried to get our cook to come with me to see my fantastic find before it disappeared. He just laughed at my excited story and told me that what I saw was noting special, just some “sun dogs.” He said I’d be sure to see many more before I left. And sure enough, I did. When I got back from the dig, I asked Professor Clark about the “sun dogs,” and she’s going to tell us more about them. 27It seems like only yesterday that I was sitting where you are, just finishing my first year of medical school and wondering if I’d ever get a chance to use all my new knowledge on a real live patient! Well, I have good news for you! You don’t have to wait until your third or fourth year of medical school to get some hands-on experience! The dean has invited me here to tell you about the university’s rural opportunity program. If you enroll in this program, you can have the opportunity this summer, after your first year of medical school, to spend from four to six weeks observing and assisting a real physician like me in a small rural community. You won’t have to compete with other students for time and attention, and you can see what life as a country doctor is really like. The program was designed to encourage medical students like yourselves to consider careers in rural communities that are still understaffed. It seems that medical students are afraid to go into rural family practice for two reasons. First, they don’t know much about it. And second, specialists in the cities usually make more money. But, on the up-side, in rural practice, doctors can really get to know their patients and be respected members of the community. I participated in the program when it first started and spent six weeks in a small rural town. Let me tell you, it was really great! I got to work with real patients. I watched the birth of a child, assisted an accident victim, and had lots of really practical hands-on experience—all in one summer. And to my surprise, I found that country life has a lot to offer that city life doesn’t—no pollution or traffic jams, for instance! My experience made me want to work where I’m needed and appreciated. I don’t miss the city at all! 28In the few minutes that remain of today’s class, I’d like to discuss next week’s schedule with you. Because I’m presenting a paper at a conference in Detroit on Thursday, I won’t be here for either Wednesday’s or Friday’s class. I will, however, be here for Monday’s. Next Friday, a week from today, is the midterm exam, marking the halfway point in the semester. Professor Andrews has agreed to administer the exam. In place of the usual Wednesday class, I’ve arranged an optional review session. Since it is optional, attendance will not be taken; however, attending the class would be a good idea for those worried about the midterm. So, remember: optional class next Wednesday; midterm, Friday. 29Today’s lecture will center on prehistoric people of the Nevada desert. Now, most of these prehistoric desert people moved across the countryside throughout the year. You might think that they were wandering aimlessly—far from it! They actually followed a series of carefully planned moves. Where they moved depended on where food was available—places where plants were ripening or fish were spawning. Now often when these people moved, they carried all their possessions on their backs, but if the journey was long, extra food and tools were sometimes stored in caves or beneath rocks. One of these caves is now an exciting archaeological site. Beyond its small opening is a huge underground grotto. Even though the cave’s very large, it was certainly too dark and dusty for the travelers to live in, but it was a great place to hide things, and tremendous amounts of food supplies and artifacts have been found there. The food includes dried fish, seeds, and nuts. The artifacts include stone spear points and knives; the spear points are actually rather small. Here’s a picture of some that were found. You can see their size in relation to the hands holding them. 30To us, the environment in which fish dwell often seems cold, dark, and mysterious. But there are advantages to living in water, and they have played an important role in making fish what they are. One is that water isn’t subject to sudden temperature changes. Therefore it makes an excellent habitat for a cold-blooded animal. Another advantage is the water’s ability to easily support body weight. Protoplasm has approximately the same density as water, so a fish in water is almost weightless. This “weightlessness” in turn means two things: One, a fish can get along with a light weight and simple bone structure, and two, limitations to a fish’s size are practically removed. Yet there is one basic difficulty to living in water—the fact that it’s incompressible. For a fish to move through water, it must actually shove it aside. Most can do this by wiggling back and forth in snakelike motion. The fish pushes water aside by the forward motion of its head, and with the curve of its body and its flexible tail. Next, the water flows back along the fish’s narrowing sides, closing in at the tail, and helping the fish propel itself forward. The fact that water is incompressible has literally shaped the development of fish. A flat and angular shape can be moved through water only with difficulty. And for this reason, fish have a basic shape that is beautifully adapted to deal with this peculiarity. 31Current studies show that what goes on labels is an important consideration for manufacturers, since more than seventy percent of shoppers read food labels when considering whether to buy a product. A recent controversy as to whether labels on prepared foods should educate or merely inform the consumer is over, and a consumer group got its way. The group had maintained that product labels should do more than simply list how many grams of nutrients a food contains. Their contention was that labels should also list the percentage of a day’s total nutrients that the product will supply to the consumer, because this information is essential in planning a healthy diet. A government agency disagreed strongly, favoring a label that merely informs the consumer, in other words, a label that only lists the contents of the products. The agency maintained that consumers could decide for themselves if the food is nutritious and is meeting their daily needs. The consumer group, in supporting its case, had cited a survey in which shoppers were shown a food label, and were then asked if they would need more or less of a certain nutrient after eating a serving of this product. The shoppers weren’t able to answer the questions easily when they were not given a specific percentage. This study, and others helped get the new regulation passed, and now food products must have the more detailed labels. 32Good afternoon. I’m here today to talk to you about a career with our airline. We’re especially interested in recruiting people to fill openings for flight attendants. First of all, to work as a flight attendant with us, you must be accepted into our training program and with so many people applying, it’s not easy to be selected. From the thousands of applications that we receive annually, we choose fewer than a thousand people for training. So, we require experience serving the public; and it also helps if you’ve earned some college credits. Also, not everybody who gets accepted into the training program makes it through. The course meets six days a week for five weeks. The training includes extensive classroom work in such subjects as first aid and passenger psychology as well as practical training in flight procedures and meal service. A lot of our graduates say that our flight attendants develop the skills of a nurse, a headwaiter, and a public relations executive! But, as a flight attendant myself, I can say that all of the hard work is worth it. Of course, I get to travel throughout the country, and the airline pays all of my expenses while I’m away from my base station. And, what I like best of all is that I’ve made friends with people from all over the country! 33Today I want to talk about the Earth’s last major climatic shift, at the end of the last ice age. But first, let’s back up a moment and review what we know about climatic change in general. First, we defined “climate” as consistent patterns of weather over significant periods of time. In general, changes in climate occur when the energy balance of the Earth is disturbed. Solar energy enters the Earth’s atmosphere as light and is radiated by the Earth’s surface as heat. Land, water, and ice each affect this energy exchange differently. The system is so complex that, to date, our best computer models are only crude approximations and are not sophisticated enough to test hypotheses about the causes of climatic change. Of course, that doesn’t keep us from speculating. For instance, volcanic activity is one mechanism that might affect climatic change. When large volcanoes erupt, they disperse tons of particles into the upper atmosphere, where the particles then reflect light. Since less light is entering the system of energy exchange, the result would be a cooling of the Earth’s surface. Of course, this is just one possible mechanism of global climate change. In all probability, a complete explanation would involve several different mechanisms operating at the same time. 34I know you’re anxious to get your permits and get started. But there’re just a few things I’d like to mention that might help you avoid trouble during your stay. First of all, make sure you carry adequate water. You’ll need it if you’re hiking, especially in this heat. A good rule of thumb is to bring one gallon per person per day this time of year. Don’t try to rely on the park’s natural springs to supply all your water needs. And please, do not use soap in the springs. It’s your responsibility to protect the park’s natural features. For those of you staying beyond the weekend, make sure that you set up camp well away from dry creekbeds. We may get some heavy rainfall, and those creekbeds could quickly become filled with water, and you and all your equipment might end up washed downstream. When you pick up your permits, you’ll also get a park services booklet. It’ll tell you everything you need to know about the hiking trails. They vary in length, of course, but most of them are under five miles—relatively easy day hikes. Remember, if you’re hiking solo, make sure you let someone know you’re going and when they can expect you back. And . . . uh, for your own safety, we recommend that you not climb rock faces. A lot of the rock throughout the park is very unstable. One final word: watch out for poisonous snakes. Rattlesnake activity is at its peak this time of year, especially at night. For your own good, we recommend wearing protective clothing and carry a flashlight after dark. 35Last week we talked about Anne Bradstreet and the role of women in the Puritan colonies. Today I want to talk about some other women who’ve contributed to American history—some famous and some not-so-famous. The first woman I’d like to talk about is Molly Pitcher. Those of you who are familiar with the name may know her as a hero of the American Revolution. But, in fact, there never was a woman named Molly Pitcher. Her real name was actually Mary Ludwig Hays. She got the nickname Molly Pitcher for her acts of bravery during the Revolutionary War. As the story goes, when Mary’s—or Molly’s—husband, John Hays, enlisted in the artillery, Mary followed, like many other wives did. She helped out doing washing and cooking for the soldiers. She was known to be a pretty unusual woman. She smoked a pipe and chewed tobacco. Anyway, in the summer of 1778, at the Battle of Monmouth, it was a blistering hot day, maybe over a hundred degrees, and fifty soldiers died of thirst during the battle. Molly wasn’t content to stay back at camp. Instead, she ran through gunshots and cannon fire carrying water in pitchers from a small stream out to the thirsty American soldiers. The relief that she brought with her pitchers of water gave her the legendary nickname Molly Pitcher. The story also says that she continued to load and fire her husband’s cannon after he was wounded. They say she was so well liked by the other soldiers that they call her “Sergeant Molly.” In fact, legend has it that George Washington himself gave her the special military title. 36Today we’re going to talk about shyness and discuss recent research on ways to help children learn to interact socially. Many people consider themselves shy. In fact, forty percent of people who took part in our survey said they were shy. That’s two out of every five people. And there are studies to indicate that the tendency toward shyness may be inherited. But just because certain children are timid, doesn’t mean they are doomed to be shy forever. There are things parents, teachers, and the children themselves can do to overcome this tendency and even to prevent it. One researcher found that if parents gently push their shy children to try new things, they can help these children become less afraid and less inhibited. Another way to help shy children is to train them in social skills. For example, there are special training groups where children are taught things like looking at other children while talking to them, talking about other people’s interests, and even smiling. These groups have been very successful at giving shy children a place to feel safe and accepted, and at building up their self-esteem. 37We’ve just seen two contemporary large birds that cannot fly: the emu and the ostrich. Over here is an interesting specimen from the past. This stuffed animal is not the giant penguin it appears to be, but an auk. This particular kind of auk is very rare, only 78 skins are known to exist and most are not preserved as well as this one. The great auk, as you can see, was a rather large bird, and it couldn’t fly either. However, evidence suggests that the auk was an excellent swimmer and diver. Unfortunately, those abilities did not protect it from being easy prey for hungry sailors who years ago sailed the very cold and often icy waters of Greenland, Iceland, and Scotland. In fact, records indicate that the auk was rather tasty and that its eggs. Excuse me . . . that its eggs and feathers were useful as well. Still, it isn’t clear what other factors led to the big bird’s demise around 1844, the last time anyone reported seeing one. Of course, we believe it’s important to take extra precautions to preserve the remaining great auk skins. After all, these specimens should prove invaluable for future scientific research. Does anyone have any questions before we move on to our next bird exhibit? 38I’d like to begin by thanking Dr. Kane for inviting me to be here today. Although I’m not a geologist, I have been collecting minerals for years. My collection is really diverse because I’ve traveled all over the world to find them. Today I’ve brought a few specimens for you to see. After I discuss each one, I’ll pass it around so that you can look at it more closely. As you know, feldspars are the most abundant minerals and are divided into a number of types. These first samples are orthoclases. Notice that they vary in color from white to pink to red. This glassy one is found in volcanic rock. In fact, I found it in New Mexico on a collecting trip. This next sample that I’ll pass around is a microcline mineral, also called amazonstone. You can identify it by its bright green color. It’s often used in jewelry and really is quite attractive. These final samples are all plagioclase feldspars. Many plagioclases are very rare, so I’m particularly proud of the variety in my collection. I’ve also brought a few slides of some larger mineral samples, and if you’ll turn out the light now, I’d like to show them to you. 39Welcome to Yellowstone National Park. Before we begin our nature walk today, I’d like to give you a short history of our National Park Service. The National Park Service began in the late 1800’s. A small group of explorers had just completed a month-long exploration of the region that is now Yellowstone. They gathered around a campfire, and after hours of discussion, they decided that they should not claim this land for themselves. They felt it should be accessible to everyone. So they began a campaign to preserve this land for everyone’s enjoyment. Two years later, in the late nineteenth century, an act of Congress signed by President Ulysses S. Grant proclaimed the Yellowstone region a public park. It was the first national park in the world. After Yellowstone became a public park, many other areas of great scenic importance were set aside, and in 1916 the National Park Service was established to manage these parks. As a park ranger, I am an employee of the National Park Service. In a national park, park rangers are on duty at all times to answer questions and help visitors in any difficulty. Nature walks, guided tours, and campfire talks are offered by specially training staff members. The park service also protects the animals and plants within the parks. 40I need to make sure you understand how to get housing for next year. When you entered as first-year students this year, the school assigned you to a dorm and a roommate, but next year as returning students you’ll choose both your roommate and your dorm. But whether or not you actually get to live in your first choice depends on what number you or your roommate draws in the lottery system. The system gives priority to the students who have been here longest. Fourth-year students get the first block of numbers, third-years get the second block, and second-years—like you’ll be—get the third. The lower the number you draw, the sooner you choose. Number one gets the first choice, number two gets the second choice, and so on. You can use either your own or your intended roommate’s number to make your room choice. If your roommate for next year has been at the school longer than you have, they’ll be in a better block of numbers and so will have a better number than any second-year student. But most of you will probably be rooming with other second-year students and so neither of you may have a great number. You may not get into your first or even second choice. Of course, if you’ve made plans to live off campus, you don’t need to enter the lottery at all. Dorm space will be especially tight this year because the dorms on North Campus will be closed for renovations. This means that those of you who draw the worst numbers won’t be able to get dorm housing at all. In that case, the housing office will help you find off-campus housing. 41Before I tell you about the interesting discovery related to Tyrannosaurus rex, I need to review something we studied last semester, the difference between what are commonly called cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals. In warm-blooded animals, birds and mammals, for example, the body temperature normally stays within a narrow range, no matter what the outside temperature is. As a result, a warm-blooded animal is usually active in both cold and hot weather because its body temperature can adjust to the temperature of its environment. On the other hand, cold-blooded animals, such as most reptiles, amphibians, and insects, are unable to create enough heat internally to raise their temperature above the temperature of the environment. So, for example, the temperature of a cold-blooded animal falls when the environment is cool. I hope this distinction is clear. Now, moving on to Tyrannosaurus rex, you may know that dinosaurs, being reptiles, are generally believed to have been cold-blooded. Well, a recent research study found that the chemical composition of the bones of Tyrannosaurus rex was consistent with the bones of an animal that has a very narrow range of internal temperature, indicating that it was probably warm-blooded. 42Thank you all for coming out this evening to meet sociologist Ellen Lambert. Ms. Lambert specializes in research on the workplace and recently has been writing about the future of work. This topic should be of special interest, since I know many of you are already at the forefront of workplace technology. For example, let’s have a show of hands to see how many people here telecommute at least part of the time. Hmm. I see eight hands raised. Well, you eight folks who work at home and communicate with your office via computer represent one of the trends Ms. Lambert has described: that people are becoming less tied to the workplace. One of the important tools for telecommuting is electronic mail, or E-mail. E-mail lets you send and receive messages almost immediately on your computer, but you control when you read them and when you respond to them. This technology allows people to have more control over time than when relying solely on the telephone. Our guest tonight will discuss how these important changes will alter the way we work. But, before turning the floor over to Ms. Lambert, I would just like to remind you that she will be available to answer any individual questions at the reception immediately following this talk. 43I’m sure almost every one of you looked at your watch or at a clock before you came to class today. Watches and clocks seem as much a part of our life as breathing or eating. And yet, did you know that watches and clocks were scarce in the United States until the 1850’s? In the late 1700’s, people didn’t know the exact time unless they were near a clock. Those delightful clocks in the squares of European towns were built for the public. After all, most citizens simply couldn’t afford a personal timepiece. Well into the 1800’s in European and the United States, the main purpose of a watch, which, by the way, was often on a gold chain, was to show others how wealthy you were. The word “wristwatch” didn’t even enter the English language until nearly 1900. By then the rapid pace of industrialization in the Unites States meant that measuring time had become essential. How could the factory worker get to work on time unless he or she knew exactly what time it was? Since efficiency was now measured by how fast a job was done, everyone was interested in time. And since industrialization made possible the manufacture of large quantities of goods, watches became fairly inexpensive. Furthermore, electric lights kept factories going around the clock. Being on time had entered the language—and life—of every citizen. 44This room is devoted to electric fish. The eel in the tank behind me can produce a strong jolt of electricity to stun its prey, but most of the fish in here produce only weak electrical impulses that are useful for navigating, locating food, and even for communicating. The knife fish is a good example. This fish navigates, using tiny receptors in the skin that are sensitive to electrical impulses. The knife fish produces an electrical signal, and the receptors in its skin let it know when the signal is distorted by a tree root, or some other obstacle, so it can go around it. Fish also use the ability to produce and detect electrical impulses to communicate. They can tell each other what species they belong to, how big they are, and whether they’re male or female. We have a tank here that’s specially equipped to convert the inaudible signals the fish produce into sounds you can hear when you put on these headphones. I urge you all to listen in when I’m done speaking. Now have a look at the electric rays. Rays are especially interesting to medical researchers because of the organs they use to produce electricity. These organs contain a chemical that carries signals from one nerve ending to the next, not only in rays, but also in people. By studying these organs, scientists hope to learn more about diseases that interrupt the transmission of impulses from one nerve to another. 45So, why did what is now called “modern dance” begin in the United States? To begin to answer this question, I’ll need to backtrack a little bit and talk about classical ballet. By the late 1800’s, ballet had lost a lot of its popularity. Most of the ballet dancers who performed in the United States were brought over from Europe. They performed using the rigid techniques that had been passed down through the centuries. Audiences and dancers in the United States were eager for their own, “contemporary” dance form. And, so, around 1900, dancers created one. So, how was this “modern” dance so different from classical ballet? Well, most notably, it wasn’t carefully choreographed. Instead, the dance depended on the improvisation and free, personal expression of the dancers. Music and scenery were of little importance to the “modern” dance, and lightness of movement wasn’t important either. In fact, modern dancers made no attempt at all to conceal the effort involved in a dance step. But even if improvisation appealed to audiences, many dance critics were less than enthusiastic about the performances. They questioned the artistic integrity of dancers who were not professionally trained and the artistic value of works that had no formal structure. Loie Fuller, after performing Fire Dance, was described as doing little more than turning “round and round like an eggbeater.” Yet, the free, personal expression of the pioneer dancers is the basis of the “controlled freedom” of modern dance today. 46Today I want to discuss fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. The term “fossil fuel” refers to the trapped remains of plants and animals in sedimentary rock. You see, living plants trap energy from the sun by the process of photosynthesis, and they store the energy in their chemical compounds. Most of that energy is released when the plant dies and decays. However, sometimes organic matter is buried before it decays completely. In this way some of the solar energy becomes trapped in rocks, hence the name fossil fuel. Although the amount of organic matter trapped in any one growing season is small, the accumulated remains from millions of years are considerable. Because the accumulation rate is so slow, millions of times slower than the rate at which we now dig up this organic matter and burn it for energy, we must consider fossil fuels as nonrenewable resources. Tomorrow we’ll be discussing alternatives to fossil fuels that can be renewed. 47We’ve been together now in this pottery class for several weeks, and I feel you are all doing very well. I thought you might be interested in hearing about a ceramics workshop that will be held here at the college next month. Kate Ferguson, who was recently named by Ceramics Monthly as one of the dozen best potters in the world, will be at the recreation center for an intensive seven-day workshop. Participants in the workshop will, Kate has assure me, make a lot of pots and be able to work closely with her on refining their techniques and skills. There’s only room for eighteen potters and advanced pottery students in the workshop, so everyone will get personal attention. It costs $175, which included all your materials, and a picnic, which is usually attended by all of the participants at the end of the workshop. A $50 deposit is required ahead of time, with the rest of the tuition due by May 15th. I should mention that this workshop is cosponsored by the Van Howe Chemical Company, which is donating the clay. If you want to register for the workshop you should call the recreation center at 5553080. You should really consider taking advantage of this opportunity. 48You might think that most of the patients at sleep clinics are being treated for sleeplessness, commonly referred to as insomnia, but that is not the case. The majority of sleep-clinic patients suffer from disorders of excessive sleep, or “hypersomnia.” While most insomniacs somehow manage to drag themselves through the day and function at acceptable, although not optimal levels, this is not so for people who suffer from hypersomnia. They are incapacitated by irresistible urges to sleep during the day, often in inappropriate situations—at business meetings, in supermarkets, or at parties. Even more dangerous is their failure to remain awake when driving or operating machinery. Falling asleep in such situations could obviously be life-threatening. Many hypersomniacs suffer from narcolepsy, for which the primary symptom is excessive daytime sleepiness. Though not apparent in childhood, this symptom most often appears for the first time during the teen years and continues throughout a person’s life. The sleep attacks may occur as many as fifteen to twenty times during the course of the day and last for periods from fifteen minutes up to two hours. What can be done to help those suffering from narcolepsy? There are certain drugs that can help, and specialists suggest voluntary napping to decrease the frequency of such sleep attacks. 49Not long ago, some of you may have read about a team of mountain-climbing scientists who helped to recalculate the elevation of the highest mountain in the world: Mt. Everest. Of course, the elevation of Mt. Everest was determined many years ago, using traditional surveying methods. But these scientists wanted to make a more precise measurement using a new method that takes advantage of recent advances in technology. It’s called the Global Positioning System. The Global Positioning System uses 24 satellites that circle the Earth. Each of these satellites is constantly sending out signals. And each signal contains important information that can be used to determine the longitude, latitude, and elevation of any point on the Earth’s surface. Well, in order to use this system to calculate Mt. Everest’s elevation, scientists needed to put a special receiver on its summit to receive signals from the satellites. The problem with this was that, in the past, the receivers were much too heavy for climbers to carry. But now these receivers have been reduced to about the size and weight of a handheld telephone, so climbers were able to take a receiver to the top of Everest and, from there, to access the satellite system signals that would allow them to determine the precise elevation. And it turns out that the famous peak is actually a few feet higher than was previously thought. 50Human populations near the equator have evolved dark skin over many generations because of exposure to the fierce rays of the Sun. A similar phenomenon has also occurred in other parts of the animal kingdom. The African grass mouse is a good example. Most mice are nocturnal, but the African grass mouse is active during daylight hours. This means that it spends its days searching for food in the semidry bush and scrub habitats of eastern and southern Africa. Its fur is striped, like a chipmunk’s, which helps it blend in with its environment. Because it spends a lot of time in the intense tropical sun, the grass mouse has also evolved two separate safeguards against the Sun’s ultraviolet radiation. First, like the populations of humans in this region of the world, the skin of the grass mouse contains lots of melanin, or dark pigment. Second, and quite unusual, this mouse has a layer of melanin-pigmented tissue between its skull and skin. This unique “cap” provides an extra measure of protection for the grass mouse and three other types of African mouse-like rodents that are active during the day. The only other species scientists have identified with the same sort of skull adaptation is the white tent-making bat of the Central American tropics. Although these bats sleep during the day, they do so curled up with their heads exposed to the sun. 51We’re going to start today talking about congressional aides, that is, the people who work for our congressional representatives, both in Washington and in the representatives’ local districts. It used to be that members of Congress had a relatively small staff of people working for them, and the role of these people wasn’t of primary importance. But now there are thousands of congressional aides, and they’ve profoundly affected the way the whole government works. Congressional aides work in two different locations: one, in the congressional representatives’ local offices, the districts from which they were elected, and two, in Washington. Staff in the local offices help members of Congress stay in touch with citizens in their districts. These citizens can bring problems in in person, or by mail or phone. This personal connection between the aides and the local people can be helpful when the next election comes around. People remember the help they get from the office of their local congressional representative. But as you know, members of Congress have to spend most of their time in Washington taking care of their legislative duties. Over six thousand new laws are introduced in Congress each session. Without help, representatives would have trouble keeping up with the proposed laws that directly affect their districts. So that’s why the congressional aides play a major role in Washington. They keep their bosses informed about pending legislation, organize hearings, and just keep their local congressional representatives up-to-date and informed on what’s going on in other parts of Congress. Now another thing congressional aides do is to help develop ideas for laws that their bosses can eventually propose to Congress. This can be called the staff’s entrepreneurial function, a bit like a business executive trying to find out what products are most popular. Congressional aides promote or encourage laws they think will be popular with the public. You’ve also got other employees that work for the whole Congress, not just for individual members. We’ll talk about these people next. 52Now, you’ve been reading articles about the tremendous damage done to life and property by earthquakes. That’s why seismologists have been working so hard to develop methods of earthquake prediction. We can now predict earthquakes fairly well, but the predictions only locate potential areas of danger. They don’t predict the specific time and location at which an earthquake is likely to occur. Today I want to introduce to you three prediction models that have been developed. The first prediction model looks along earthquake faults, those cracks in the Earth’s crust, to find what are known as seismic gaps. Seismic gaps are places where the fault has shown little or no seismic activity for a long time. This theory postulates that such places are due for a major shock. The second model relies on phenomena, like ground flit. Using long cylindrical tubes containing water, observers noted that ground tilt tended to occur before major earthquakes. That led them to correctly predict the big Haicheng quake of 1975, the first successful earthquake prediction scientists have ever made. A million people were evacuated from that Chinese city before the earthquake struck. Unfortunately, this method hasn’t worked consistently, so we can’t say it’s been perfected. The third model is based on the theory that major earthquakes closely follow a series of minor ones. Starting with the measurements and timing of the smaller quakes, a complex formula calculates the “times of increased probability” of a much larger quake. Right now, this method, like the first method, cannot predict specific times and places, but that may change as it is further developed. For the moment, none of these models can predict with reasonable levels of confidence. 53That’s an interesting question, Tom. Women did participate in the early days of motion-picture making. One of the most outstanding is Lois Weber. She is credited as the first consistently successful woman film director. In the early 1900’s, when she first arrived in Hollywood, Ms. Weber made a series of experimental sound films. Now this was almost 20 years before modern “talking pictures” were developed. The dialogue for her movies was recorded on phonograph records and then synchronized with the action on the movie screen, very innovative for that time. In addition, Weber felt that movies should be educational as well as entertaining. She made several highly controversial movies that dealt with the moral and social issues of her day. And some of her most controversial work addressed issues of particular interest to women. Unfortunately, Weber died in 1939, just as Hollywood was beginning to make films aimed primarily at female audiences, which brings me to my next point. 54Well, if there are no more questions, I would like to continue our discussion of human evolution by looking at Homo erectus, the earliest of our ancestors who stood upright. Homo erectus lived about one and a half million years ago and was given that name because, at the time the first fossil was discovered, it represented the first primate to stand upright. There is evidence now that Homo erectus had sharper mental skills than their predecessors. They constructed the first standardized tool for hunting and butchering. They created an extraordinary stone implement, a large teardrop-shaped hand ax whose design and symmetry reveal a keen sense of aesthetics. This detailing, along with the ax’s utilitarian value, strongly suggests that Homo erectus had the ability to conceive of and execute a design to specification. In addition, Homo erectus was the first hominid to use fire. This discovery enticed them to cook meat, which they could flavor and keep from spilling by flame, and which paleontologists now believe may have given them a new disease. Some fossil bones of Homo erectus are grossly deformed, and paleontologists have noted that this condition is similar to that found in people today who have been exposed to chronic overdoses of vitamin A. Apparently Homo erectus first got this disease by eating large amounts of animal liver. 55Yesterday we talked about the anecdote. Today we’re going to move on to one of the most popular literary forms in Western literature—the short story. A short story is a piece of prose fiction, usually under 10,000 words. Although it’s similar to the anecdote, it’s really a separate literary form. You’ll remember that the anecdote’s sole purpose is to entertain, and that it does this by relating a curious or interesting event. Well, there are also events in short stories, but the short story uses the event as something a character reacts to. The reader’s interest is captured by the effect that this event has on the character in the story. We’re even likely to reread a short story to better understand the character who is being portrayed and why a certain event led to a certain response or action. A short story, though, is not just a short novel. A novel is narrative. It tells a detailed story that usually takes place over a long period of time. A short story is less comprehensive than a novel, and the focus is on a character’s mental reaction to an experience. This reaction is the heart of the short story. Now I want you to think back to the short story you read for homework and I’ll give you a list of questions to think about. 56One reason oceanographers analyze the sediment on the ocean floor is to see how long-term changes in Earth’s temperature have affected the depth of the ocean. By analyzing the remains of sea animals in old layers of ocean sediment, oceanographers can determine the depth of the ocean in the past. They’ve analyzed hundreds of such layers, including some from the coldest periods of Earth’s history—the ice ages. What they’ve found is that during the ice ages, the amount of water in the oceans decreased. Water levels in the ocean dropped by about four hundred feet. Water from the ocean evaporated and became frozen in continental glaciers, so it didn’t drain back into the ocean. When temperatures eventually rose again, the glaciers melted, and the oceans returned to their former depths. Analysis of sedimentary data indicates that periods of glacial freezing and melting occurred in regular cycles of twenty thousand, forty thousand, and one hundred thousand years. Oceanographers are interested in the history of seawater levels because they hope to use this historical data in order to predict the possible effect that global warming could have on seawater levels. If industrial pollutants are capable of heating global temperatures to the point that glaciers begin to melt, it is urgent for us to know precisely how high sea levels will rise as a result. 57Now let’s focus on comics in the 1950’s. Early in the decade sales were down, so publishers started looking for some new angle to get their readers interested again. They found what they were looking for with horror comics, stories about ghosts and demons that were often graphically violent. Before long, most of the major publishers were printing horror comics, but it all came to an end a few years later. You see, there was a psychologist named Frederic Wertham who claimed that comic books, the horror books in particular, were a bad influence on children and turned them into juvenile delinquents. Wertham even wrote a book called Seduction of the Innocent that showed specific scenes from comics that he thought were a particularly bad influence on kids. Wertham wasn’t the only one down on comics. The United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency also released a report very critical of comics. The result of all this fuss was the creation of the Comics Code Authority in 1995. This is a self-censoring body created by the publishers. Essentially, for a comic book to be approved by the code, it had to be free of the blood and gore that was usually depicted in most horror comics, and evil could never triumph over good. Children had to be shown that crime did not pay. Well, if comic sales were bad in 1950, things got even worse in 1955. Many small publishers actually went out of business. But the industry rebounded by introducing a new lineup of superheroes, characters like Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four. Now, I’ve brought with me today some comic books from this era to pass around. They’re from my own personal collection, so please be extra careful when handling them. 58As you probably know, log structures are gaining in popularity. They are no longer just the simple country homes that we think of as the traditional log cabin. Some upscale homes now incorporate natural round logs in ceiling beams and walls. People seem to think the rounded logs give their homes a cozy, warm atmosphere. And even people who want to build a traditional log cabin on their own can buy a kit with precut logs that fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Before showing you some slides of modern log houses, I’d like to give a little historical background on the subject: Log cabins were first built in the late 1600’s along the Delaware River valley. The European immigrants who settled there brought centuries-old traditions of working with logs. And in this heavily wooded area, logs were the material at hand. Log cabins were most popular in the early 1800’s with the settlers who were moving west. They provided the answer to the pioneers’ need for a safe and sturdy home that an ordinary family could build quickly: they had dirt floors and sliding boards for windows. But the log buildings that have probably had most influence on modern architects are those of the mountain retreats of wealthy New Yorkers. These country houses, which were popular in the early 1900’s, typify what’s known as the Adirondack style. Now let’s look at those slides. 59The Old Canada Road is a long-lost trail between the Canadian province of Quebec and Maine, in the northeast corner of the United States. Yes, it really was lost, and finding it again was a complex process that involved state-of-the-art technology. How the location of the road was pinpointed was very interesting, and I’ll return to it as soon as I’ve given you a little background information. The road was begun in 1817, a few years before Maine even became a state. At the time, Quebec was a major market for livestock, crops, and fish, so a road to Quebec was seen by officials in Maine as necessary for trade. For about 20 years, the movement of people and goods was mostly from Maine to Quebec, but then the trend reversed as thousands of Canadians immigrated to Maine to escape poor crops, a lack of jobs, and the threat of disease. I think it was a cholera epidemic. Besides these negative reasons, major building projects in Maine also made the state very attractive for the Canadians who needed work. I should stress, though, that immigration during that period went in both directions. In fact, the flow of people and goods went completely unhindered. There wasn’t even a border post until around 1850. The people of the time saw Maine and Quebec as a single region, mainly because of the strong French influence, which is still evident in Maine today. Eventually, the road fell into disuse as a major railway was completed; finally, people simply forgot about it and that’s how it came to be lost. This brings me back to the original topic. 60OK. In the last class we talked about the classification of trees, and we ended up with a basic description of angiosperms. You remember that those are plants with true flowers and seeds that develop inside fruits. The common broadleaf trees we have on campus fall into this category, but our pines don’t. Now, I hope you all followed my advice and wore comfortable shoes because, as I said, today we’re going to do a little field study. To get started, let me describe a couple of the broadleaf trees we have in front of us. I’m sure you’ve all noticed this big tree next to Brant Hall. It’s a black walnut that must be 80 feet tall. As a matter of fact, there’s a plaque identifying it as the tallest black walnut in the state. And from here we can see the beautiful archway of trees at the Commons. They’re American elms. The ones along the Commons were planted when the college was founded 120 years ago. They have the distinctive dark green leaves that look lopsided because the two sides of the leaf are unequal. I want you to notice the elm right outside Jackson Hall. Some of its leaves have withered and turned yellow, maybe due to Dutch elm disease. Only a few branches seem affected so far, but if this tree is sick, it’ll have to be cut down. Well, let’s move on and I’ll describe what we see as we go. 61I was really glad when your club invited me to share my coin collection. It’s been my passion since I collected my first Lincoln cent in 1971; that’s the current penny with Abraham Lincoln’s image. Just a little history before I start in on my own collection. Lincoln pennies are made of copper, and they were the first United States coin to bear the likeness of a President. It was back in 1909 when the country was celebrating the centennial of Lincoln’s birth in 1809 that the decision was made to redesign the one-cent piece in his honor. Before that, the penny had an American Indian head on it. The new penny was designed by artist Victor David Brenner. This is interesting because he put his initials V.D.B. on the reverse of the coin in its original design. There was a general uproar when the initials were discovered, and only a limited number of the coins were struck with the initials on them. Today a penny with the initials from the San Francisco Mint, called the 1909-SVDB, is worth over $500. Now, when I started my coin collection, I began with the penny for several reasons. There were a lot of them. Several hundred billion have been minted, and there were a lot of people collecting them, so I had plenty of people to trade with and talk to about my collection. Also, it was a coin I could afford to collect as a young teenager. In the twenty-five years since then, I have managed to acquire over 300 coins, some of them very rare. I’ll be sharing with you today some of my rarer specimens, including the 1909-SVDB. 62Today I want to talk to you about wasps and their nests. You’ll recall that biologists divide species of wasps into two groups: solitary and social. Solitary wasps, as the name implies, do not live together with other wasps. In most species the male and female get together only to mate, and then the female does all the work of building the nest and providing food for the offspring by herself. Solitary wasps usually make nests in the ground and they separate the chambers for individual offspring with bits of grass, stone, or mud, whatever is handy. What about social wasps? They form a community and work together to build and maintain the nest. A nest begins in the spring when a fertile female, called the queen, builds the first few compartments of the nest and lays eggs. The first offspring are small females that cannot lay eggs. These females, called workers, then build a lot of new compartments, and the queen lays more eggs. They also care for the new offspring and defend the nest with their stingers. By the way, only female wasps have stingers. Most social wasps make nests of paper. The females produce the paper by chewing up plant fibers or old wood. They spread the paper in thin layers to make cells in which the queen lays her eggs. Most of you, I’m sure, have seen these nests suspended from trees. They may also be built underground in abandoned rodent burrows. 63One of the most popular myths about the United States in the nineteenth century was that of the free and simple life of the farmer. It was said that farmers worked hard on their own land to produce whatever their families needed. They might sometimes trade with neighbors; but in general they could get along just fine by relying on themselves, not on commercial ties with others. This is how Thomas Jefferson idealized the farmer at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and, at that time, this may have been close to the truth, especially on the frontier. But by mid-century, sweeping changes in agriculture were well under way as farmers began to specialize in the raising of crops such as cotton or corn or wheat. By late in the century, revolutionary advances in farm machinery had vastly increased production of specialized crops. And the extensive network of railroads had linked farmers throughout the country to markets in the East and even overseas. By raising and selling specialized crops, farmers could afford more and finer goods and achieve a much higher standard of living, but at a price. Now, farmers were no longer dependent just on the weather and their own efforts. Their lives were increasingly controlled by banks, which had power to grant or deny loans for new machinery, and by the railroads, which set the rates for shipping their crops to market. As businessmen, farmers now had to worry about national economic depressions and the influence of world supply and demand on, for example, the price of wheat in Kansas. And so, by the end of the nineteenth century, the era of Jefferson’s independent farmer had come to a close. 64Before moving on to a new topic, I want to finish up our unit on arachnids by looking at what may seem a very unusual aspect of spider behavior, a species where the young spiders actually consume the body of their mother. Unlike most other spiders, this species lays one, and only one, clutch of 40 eggs in her lifetime. The young spiders hatch in mid-spring or early summer, inside a nest of eucalyptus leaves. Their mother spends the warm summer months bringing home large insects—often 10 times her weight—for meal. The catch is always significantly more than her young spiders can eat. So, the mother fattens herself up on this extra prey and stores the nutrients in her extra unfertilized eggs. As the weather turns colder, there are fewer insect prey to hunt. That’s when the nutrients stored in those extra eggs begin to seep into the mother’s bloodstream. So, when there are no more insects to feed to the young spiders, they attach themselves to the mother’s leg joints and draw nourishment by sucking the nutrient-rich blood. After several weeks, the mother is depleted of all nutrients and she dies. But then how do the young get nourishment? They start to feed on one another. Now, if you recall our discussion of Darwin, you’ll see the evolutionary value of this: Only the strongest spiders of the clutch will survive this “cannibalism,” and the mother spider will have ensured that her genes have an increased chance of survival through future generations. 65Moving away from newspapers, let’s now focus on magazines. Now, the first magazine was a little periodical called The Review, and it was started in London in 1704. It looked a lot like the newspapers of the time, but in terms of its content, it was much different. Newspapers were concerned mainly with news events, but The Review focused on important domestic issues of the day, as well as the policies of the government. Now, in England at the time, people could still be thrown in jail for publishing articles that were critical of the king. And that’s what happened to Daniel Defoe. He was the outspoken founder of The Review. Defoe actually wrote the first issue of The Review from prison! You see, he had been arrested because of his writings that criticized the policies of the Church of England, which was headed by the king. After his release, Defoe continued to produce The Review, and the magazine started to appear on a more frequent schedule, about three times a week. It didn’t take long for other magazines to start popping up. In 1709, a magazine called The Tatler began publication. This new magazine contained a mixture of news, poetry, political analysis, and philosophical essays. 66There’s an art exhibition here on campus which ties in well with the discussions we’re had about folk art. It’s an exhibition of wildlife art calendars from about a hundred years ago. Like most other folk art, the calendar pictures were not considered to be art in their own day. People just thought of them as a way of decorating a practical object. In fact, the calendar pictures were originally printed as advertising for various companies that made hunting or fishing products, like guns or fishing rods. The calendars were handed out free to customers to thank them for their business. Most people just hung the calendars on their walls where the pictures faded in the sun, and then tore the picture off the calendar as each month passed. As a result, collectors today place a lot of value on calendars that are complete and in good condition. Even though the people who used the calendars didn’t regard them as art, the original paintings the prints were made from were often of good quality. In fact, many famous wildlife painters created calendar art at some point in their lives. To them, it was a way of getting their work reproduced and shown around. One aspect of the exhibit that I find very interesting is the way these pictures reflect changing attitudes toward wildlife. The pictures in the exhibit often portray the thrill and adventure of hunting rather than any particular concern for wildlife preservation. But most of today’s wildlife art shows animals in their natural surroundings without any humans in the scene. This modern wildlife art appeals to large numbers of nature lovers, even those who oppose the practice of hunting. 67As many of you already know, March is Women’s History Month, so it’s just a few weeks until the university begins its annual observance. The Women’s Studies Program, in conjunction with the College Life Office, is pleased to announce that a full schedule of events is planned throughout March. The opening activity will be a lecture by Dr. Linda Thompson, coordinator of the Women’s Studies Program; she’ll talk about the status of women on college campuses. All students are invited to attend at eight p.m. on March first in the Student Center, Room 112. On March fourth, the Student Center Café will offer a forum for women poets to read their works. The English department’s Kate Benson will read from her recently published poetry collection The Ways of a Woman. Student poets will be encouraged to share their poems as well. Interested people should sign up at the Women’s Studies Office. On the fifteenth, come out and hear Thomas Lane, author of the best-selling The Gender Connection, talk about male-female relationships. The talk will be held in the Student Center Auditorium at 7:30 p.m. with a reception to follow. Lots of other events are being planned, including a show of the work of women artists, a panel discussion about women’s legal issues, and more. Check the campus paper for times and places, or stay tuned to WRUC for further details. 68Welcome to the largest retrospective exhibit this art museum has ever devoted to an architect. The architect chosen for this honor is Frank Lloyd Wright, probably the greatest United States architect of the twentieth century. Wright has the reputation of being arrogant and insensitive to his clients’ needs, but his work is based on a set of principles rather than a style. Because of his belief in unity of design and the elimination of unnecessary detail, he resisted his clients’ wishes to introduce what he called foreign objects to his carefully designed interiors. Frank Lloyd Wright always tried to achieve harmony of building and setting. The first drawing in the exhibit, of one of his “Prairie” houses, illustrates this integration of the house with the landscape of the American Midwest. You can see how he stresses the horizontal line with spreading roofs and strips of windows. Outside porches stretch into the gardens, making one harmonious whole. Because of this goal of harmony, you won’t see skyscrapers among his designs. Wright was criticized for his impractical houses with leaky flat roofs, but his houses also had great virtues. The design of the Prairie houses, for example, made them warm in winter and cool in summer. The drawings and photos in this exhibit will show the enormity of Frank Lloyd Wright’s contribution to modern architecture. 69Today, I’d like to turn our attention to an area of management often overlooked in traditional management courses: small-business management. Small businesses have gone from being traditional small-town stores selling food or clothing to sophisticated, high-tech enterprises. And in addition to the important products they produce, they create jobs for lots of people because there are so many of them. It’s important for management to keep in mind which of the customers’ needs the business serves, because it can’t serve all their needs. Writing a business plan that everyone in the organization understands and follows will help to provide the necessary focus and direction. It’s important to state clearly what the purpose of the business is. Additionally, each person within the organization must know what tasks to perform in order to fulfill that purpose. Now, if for some reason a business plan doesn’t work, try hard to discover why not, rewrite it, and immediately focus on the new plan. A work of caution, however, never give up a bad plan without replacing it. A business has to have a plan because it can’t afford to waste its limited resources. And, as you know, waste leads to unnecessarily high production costs. Production costs are at the heart of the company’s ability to make a high quality product and sell it at an affordable price. 70The next style of furniture design I’d like to discuss is Shaker furniture design. The Shakers are a religious group that flourished in the nineteenth-century United States. At that time, the Shakers lived in their own communities and believed in living simply. This ideal of simplicity extended to their furniture design, as you will see. Because the shape of their furniture wasn’t supposed to be unnecessarily decorative, the furniture’s surface became the only place to create visual pleasure. Shaker furniture used light-colored woods like pine, maple, or cherry. It was often painted blue, green, or yellow. As these slides show, some of their most interesting pieces were made for the workplace. Notice that this sewing table has drawers that can be pulled out from either side. This feature enables two people to sew at the same time. Likewise, if you look closely at these slides of counters and workbenches, you’ll notice that these pieces were also designed to be used from more than one side. Thus, several people would be able to work at one time. Nowadays, Shaker furniture design’s enjoying a revival. The simple but stylish furniture made by the Shakers is popular among affluent collectors, including such celebrities as Bill Cosby and Oprah Winfrey. As you’ve seen, the plainness of Shaker furniture makes it strangely modern in appearance. In fact, their austere, minimalist designs have influenced several modern furniture designers, some of whom we’ll discuss next. 71Scientists are always on the lookout for alternative sources of energy. Today we’re going to discuss one that’s so plentiful they say it could supply more energy than all the coal and oil in the world. It’s found in something called gas hydrate and, believe it or not, that’s a kind of ice. That’s right. But the water in this ice was way down below the Earth’s surface when it was frozen, so it was under a lot of pressure. And trapped inside the crystals of ice are individual molecules of methane — that’s what’s in natural gas. All this makes gas hydrate pretty strange stuff. If you touch a match to a piece of this ice, it’ll burst into flame. And when geologists bring a chunk of it up to the surface to study at normal air pressure and temperature, gas hydrate begins to hiss and bubble, and in less than half an hour, the ice melts and the methane inside escapes into the air. Now, as you might guess, this can make gas hydrate kind of hard for miners to handle. And then there’s the problem of where it’s located in frozen arctic regions or in ocean waters off the Atlantic coast, and up to a mile down. Environmentalists warn that mining it could even be disastrous. Offshore drilling could allow seawater to seep down into the huge icy deposits and release tons of methane up into the atmosphere. And methane, our listeners may recall, is a greenhouse gas that could really worsen the problem of global warming. So, gas hydrate may offer some interesting possibilities. But, with all these drawbacks, I’m not going to hold my breath waiting for it to fuel my furnace. 72Today, I want to talk about the Cariboo gold rush of 1858, which began when gold was discovered in the frontier town of Quesnel Forks in the Canadian province of British Columbia. By 1861 thousands of men had flocked to the region hoping to strike it rich. Naturally, as the town grew, supplies had to be brought in, and this was done with mules. Now the mules were quite reliable, but there were some drawbacks. For example, a mule carrying a heavy load could travel only 15 miles in a day, meaning that a typical trip into Quesnel could take as long as 20 days. So, as the demand for supplies continued to grow, a group of merchants and packers decided to try a new approach, believe it or not, they shipped in a herd of camels. I know that sounds strange, but camel trains had been used quite effectively during the California gold rush some 10 years earlier. But the results in the Cariboo region weren’t quite the same. In fact it was a disaster. The camels couldn’t carry the heavier loads the merchants expected them to. Their two-toed feet were perfect for desert travel, but they weren’t suited for Cariboo’s rugged mountain terrain. To make matters worse, the mules became very agitated whenever they came across a camel and that caused a lot of accidents on the treacherous mountain trails. The mulepackers went so far as to threaten the camel owners with a lawsuit. But the reason the merchants finally got rid of the camels is because these animals simply weren’t cut out for the job. 73Look at our topographical map and you’ll see that the middle third of the North American continent from the Rocky Mountains almost to the Mississippi River is pretty flat. This is the Great Plains. This kind of area is sometimes called a prairie, sometimes a steppe. That’s s-t-e-p-p-e. The defining features are level terrain, dry climate, and an absence of trees. The Great Plains are actually the former bed of a shallow inland sea. Over millions of years, sediment left by glaciers, water, and wind smoothed out the dry sea bed. As I said, the Great Plaints are bordered on the west by the Rocky Mountains. And it’s really the Rockies that are responsible for the formation of the grasslands. The mountains are so high that they block the heavy moist air traveling eastward form the Pacific Ocean. Lighter, drier air passes over the mountains. Until people intervened with irrigation and farms, only grass could grow on the dry, windy plain. In fact, we can divide the Great Plains into three zones. In the west, where it’s driest and windiest, the grass is very short. In the eastern zone, there’s more rain and grass grows as high as 360 centimeters. In the middle third, there’s a mix of grass species that grow to an intermediate height. 74Did you know you can catch a mood? A bad mood isn’t spread by a virus like the flu is, but it can be contagious. Moods sort of drift from person to person unconsciously. Slight, unintentional signals carry the mood. You’ve probably experienced it yourself. You’re around someone who’s feeling down and showing it—slumped shoulders, downcast mouth, subdued voice—all that sort of thing. Pretty soon you begin to feel depressed too. Of course, good moods are also catching, not just bad ones. Moods spread in steps. One person’s facial expression or whatever is observed by another, who then unconsciously begins to mimic. The process is automatic—a split second mimicry. The person isn’t even aware of the copying. A full-blown case of mood transfer develops as this copying continues. Not everyone picks up moods to the same degree. Those who’re most susceptible often have strong physiological responses to what’s going on around them. You know, people who break out in a nervous sweat easily and whose stomachs churn. People don’t all send moods equally well either. The best mood senders are expressive people because mood contagion can’t happen without signals. If they aren’t there—that is, the person gives no indication of the mood they’re in—nobody will pick up the mood. 75We’ve probably all wondered how a new word gets into the dictionary. Take the word “doofus,” for example, spelled d-o-o-f-u-s, meaning a stupid or incompetent person. This word, which has been around since the late 1960’s in a slang sense, made it into the Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary only in 1993. Why did it take so long? Well, first of all, dictionary editors like to wait at least three years to be sure a word is going to last, especially a slang word. They don’t want to put in a new word prematurely and then have to take it out in the next edition. But even for words that aren’t slang, getting into the dictionary isn’t easy. New words have to pass a lot of editorial tests, including how difficult or easy they are to look up. There’s also a limit to how thick a dictionary can be or how small its type can get before people feel they don’t want to use it. Some words have to come out before others can go in. The Collegiate Dictionary adds about ten thousand words to every edition, but it takes out only a few hundred, so choices have to be made very carefully. 76Did you ever wonder why it is that most people are “programmed” to sleep at night instead of during the day? If there’s something about the cycle of light and dark that’s telling us when to sleep, then shouldn’t the sleep cycle of a blind person be different? As it turns out, many blind people—people with no visual perception of light at all—do have the same sleep cycle as sighted people. So now you’re wondering, “How can this happen?” The answer is: hormones, one hormone in particular. It’s called melatonin. In sighted people, the level of melatonin goes up at night, or when it’s dark, and goes down in the day, or when it’s light. It’s believed that it’s the presence of this hormone in the blood that gives us the urge to sleep. If an increase in melatonin level “programs” sighted people to sleep at night, then what about blind people? A researcher, named Dr. Charles Czeisler, tells about an interesting experiment. He tried shining a bright light into the eyes of some blind people. When he did this, he noticed that the level of the melatonin in the blood of these subjects went down just as it would do for sighted people. Somehow, the eyes of these subjects, even though they were damaged and had no visual perception of light, could tell their brain when there was more or less light. Now, this doesn’t work for all blind people; in fact, most of Czeisler’s subjects had no hormonal response to light at all. Further research may be able to explain this sensitivity to light in terms of the type of blindness of the subject. 77Since we’ve been discussing alternative fuels lately, I wanted to pass on to you some information I read about a new fuel that’s been in the news a lot lately. It’s called A-21. It’s composed of water and a chemical known as naphtha. It seems to be a very promising fuel because it’s much cleaner than the gasoline that we use today. That’s not to say that it doesn’t pollute, but it is cleaner. A-21 isn’t like some other alternative fuels that require completely new types of engines. A-21 still works in regular, everyday combustion engines—like the ones in cars—with only minor mechanical modifications. So changing over wouldn’t be a big deal. You may doubt some of these claims as many researchers have. Some people feared that because it contains about 45 percent water it would freeze in the winter. But a small amount of antifreeze was added to it, and that seems to have solved the problem. A-21 has recently undergone street tests in buses in Reno, Nevada. So far it seems to work just fine. This is a good thing, especially in Nevada, because the state government there has passed a law requiring that a large percentage of vehicles in Nevada run on alternative fuels. A-21 should help. 78Today we’re going to continue our discussion of modern art and talk about Charles Csuri. Charles Csuri has been a part of many modern art movements. He’s worked in Pop Art, Cubism, and Conceptual Art, but he made his mark as a pioneer in computer art. Even long before computers became popular, he was punching cards and feeding them into the big mainframe computer at Ohio State University. In the beginning, he had to work without a monitor, so he was virtually creating art in the dark. He even learned computer programming so he could experiment with this new tool. Through the computer, Csuri has been able to explore a new world of possibilities. For example, the computer enables him to sculpt in three dimensions. Also, he can look at a sculpture from any angle, and move it around, change the location of the light source, or he can copy it in different colors. Over the years, Csuri received numerous grants for various projects. This money allowed him to train students in computer graphics and animation techniques, and to advance the computer as a medium for artists. Even though he uses modern technology, Csuri still insists he is creating art. He’s always told his students to keep the issues of art in focus, and not get so caught up in the technology that you forget about the image. 79Now we’re entering Kangaroo Country. In all, there are more than fifty different species of kangaroo, and the advantage of zoos like ours is that you see them in their natural habitat. The ones we have all live in the grasslands. On my right, you can see one of the biggest types: the red kangaroo. It travels about 20 miles per hour. It looks like hard work, but hopping actually lets the kangaroo conserve more energy than another animal could when running on four legs. In fact, up to a certain point, the faster a kangaroo goes the more energy it conserves. Rather than taking more hops to increase speed, the kangaroo makes the length of each jump longer. Let’s stop here for a minute. Take a look over on your right at this group of kangaroos resting. Can you see that their ears are moving? Hearing may well be the kangaroo’s most important sense. Their two large ears can move independently, so sometimes one ear is pointing forward and the other toward the rear. Kangaroos’ eyesight is also excellent. They have a wide field of vision and, like most grazing animals, they are especially good at detecting movement. Before we move on, I’d like to point out one more thing: If you look closely, you can see a joey that’s a baby kangaroo peering out of its mother’s pouch. Before long that joey will be out of the pouch for good. The mother will push it out by the time it’s eight months old. 80Before we adjourn, I’d like to remind everybody about the upcoming fundraising event—the ten kilometer run. The run is being organized to help raise money for the renovation of the old gym. Our gym is in desperate need of repair, and the university must rely entirely on private donations to pay for its renovation. This event will be the students’ contribution to the effort. The procedure for participating is quite simple. No entrance fees, no advance registration, and you don’t have to be the best athlete on campus. You only need to find sponsors willing to contribute one or more dollars for every kilometer of the race that you complete. So, for example, if you run all ten kilometers, you’ll collect ten dollars from someone who has pledged to give you one dollar per kilometer. After the run, a race official will record the number of kilometers you’ve completed. You can then show the record to your sponsors when you collect the money. You might encourage your friends to run in the race by telling them that there will be awards for everyone who gets five sponsors or more. But above all, it’ll just be a lot of fun. So, please spread the word and get everyone involved either as runners or sponsors. 81And as we enter this next gallery, please turn your attention to the statue on your right. It’s a bust of the seventh President of the United States, Andrew Jackson. It was done by American sculptor Hiram Powers. Mr. Powers is particularly significant to our sculpture collection here at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His statue entitled California was the first work by an American artist to become part of the collection at the Met. But back to this piece. When Powers was modeling this bust, he asked the President, who was 68 years old at the time, if he wanted to be made to appear younger than that. President Jackson replied that he didn’t; so as you can see, he’s shown here with wrinkles and lines of aging etched on his face. Consequently, this bust is considered to be one of the most realistic portrayals of Andrew Jackson. Powers traveled from his studio in Italy to the White House to do the original study for the bust. He did the study in clay, cut he sculpted the final statue from fine Italian marble, as you can see. I should add that the usual practice at the time was to get local artisans to do the actual carving of the marble. Note that the President is draped in a Roman toga. This is because in the nineteenth century that was the customary attire for representations of heads of state and other important figures. Powers kept the bust in his studio until after President Jackson’s death, when it was sold to the Democratic Club in New York City. It was lent to us here at the Met in 1874 and twenty years later became part of our permanent collection. Now, if you’ll step this way, we’ll move on to the next piece. 82If you liked the colorful animals we just saw, you’re going to love these next animals: frogs. You might not normally think of frogs as being colorful, but these frogs definitely are. They are the dart-poison frogs of Central and South America. Look at their striking colors, often yellow with black stripes or deep blue with black spots. Beyond being nice to look at, these markings have a purpose. They warn predators that these frogs are poisonous. When threatened, these frogs secrete a substance through their skin that would easily kill whatever animal might try to eat them. Their bright colors communicate this, and so most animals tend not to hunt them. Now, speaking of hunting, for centuries these frogs were sought after by hunters. As you might think, the hunters didn’t want to eat the frogs, but rather, they captured them for their poison. They would add the poison to the tips of their hunting arrows. Of course, nowadays most hunters use guns. These days, dart-poison frogs are of less interest to hunters than to medical researchers. Researchers believe that they can make new heart medicine from the poison, because it acts as a stimulant on the body’s nervous system. Researchers think they could use it to stimulate a weak heart. There is, however, a problem with doing research on these frogs. Those that are caught in the wild will produce their poison until they die. However, those that are born in captivity, like the ones you see here, will not produce any poison at all. 83Okay, as you look at this next exhibit, you’ll notice something quite common—an ordinary bar of soap. Now, soap has been around a long time. In fact, the ancient Phoenicians produced soap as a substance for washing the body way back in 600 B.C. They made it by blending goat’s fat with wood ash. The Phoenicians, as you may know, regularly traded along the Mediterranean, and they were the ones who introduced soap to the Greeks and Romans. Now, soap was not something welcomed by all countries. In fact, during the superstitious Middle Ages, many people were afraid to bathe their whole body too frequently. They thought it could be dangerous for their health—that it could even kill them. And even after the production of soap became common in some European countries in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, even then some people in the heart of Europe refused to use it. You’ll find it interesting that when a duchess was given a box of soap as a present in 1549, she was so insulted that she had the gift-giver thrown off her estate! But by the nineteenth century the attitude toward soap had changed drastically. In some regions of Europe the tax on soap was so high that people secretly made their own. A baron went so far as to suggest that the wealth of a nation could be judged according to the amount of soap it used. Now, if you turn your attention to the next exhibit, you can see how soap is manufactured today. 84The winds of a tornado are the most violent and destructive ones on Earth. Any of you who have seen one knows very well how frightening and powerful they are. What’s interesting about them is that scientists don’t actually know exactly why tornadoes occur. We do know, however, what happens when tornadoes are formed. As you remember, a front occurs when cool, dry air from the north meets warm, humid air coming from the south, from the Gulf of Mexico, for tornadoes in the United States. Where these air masses meet, a narrow zone of storm clouds develops, and thunderstorms, and sometimes tornadoes, occur. How is this violent weather produced? Well, a mass of warm, humid air rises very rapidly. As it rises, more warm air rushes in to replace it. This inrushing air also rises, and in some cases, especially when there is extreme thermal instability, begins to rotate. When this happens, the rotating air forms a tornado. Even if you’ve seen tornadoes only in movies, you know that they can demolish buildings in seconds. This is possible because when a tornado passes over a house, it sucks up air from around the house and so the air pressure outside the house drops rapidly. Inside, pressure remains the same. So, air pressure inside is greater than air pressure outside. The result is that the building explodes outward. Next, we’ll talk a little bit about how new technological developments are being used to try to predict tornadoes. 85You’ll recall that in last week’s class I talked about how the sound made by most animals, though sometimes complex, are different from human language. Only in humans do these sounds represent objects and events. Keep in mind that most animals can only repeat their limited utterances over and over again, while humans can say things that have never been said before. Today I want to focus on human language and how it developed. I doubt you’ll be surprised when I say that the evolution of language was slow and laborious. There’s some reliable evidence that language began with early humans a million and a half years ago. Through the study of the size and shape of brain fossils, scientists have determined that early human brains, like modern brains, had a left hemisphere slightly larger than the right hemisphere. We know that in modern humans, the left hemisphere’s the seat of language. We also know that early human brains had a well-developed frontal section, known as Broca’s area, which coordinates the muscles of the mouth and throat. It’s clear, then, that early humans had a speech apparatus. They could produce any sound that we can. What we don’t know is whether early humans used what they had. Since scholars know virtually nothing about prehistoric speech patterns, all they can do is speculate about how language actually originated. Let me give you a brief summary of some of these theories. 86At last month’s meeting you asked me to draw up a report about the possibility of keeping the student center open twenty-four hours a day. I decided that the best way to assess the need for expanded hours was to talk to the people who were still in the student center at closing time. First, over the course of the two weeks, I interviewed more than fifty students as they left the student center at its regular closing time of twelve midnight. About eighty percent of them said they would prefer that the center stay open later. Of the three main uses of the center—eating in the snack bar, recreation in the game room or watching TV, and studying by far the most popular late night activity is—and this may surprise you—studying. Almost all of the people I talked to said that their main reason for being in the center after ten p.m. was to study in groups or to find a quiet place to study because their dorm was too noisy. Of course, many of these people used the snack bar or TV room for breaks. My recommendation is that we ask the administration to keep the center open after midnight for studying. The recreation room and snack bar can still close at the usual time. This should meet the objection that it costs too much to staff the center from midnight to eight a.m., which I’m sure will be the first response. 87These days we take for granted the wide variety of music available on the radio. But, this wasn’t always the case. In the early days of radio, stations were capable of broadcasting only a narrow range of sounds, which was all right for the human voice but music didn’t sound very good. There was also a great deal of crackling and other static noises that further interfered with the quality of the sound. A man named Edwin Armstrong, who was a music lover, set out to change this. He invented FM radio, a technology that allowed stations to send a broad range of frequencies that greatly improved the quality of the music. Now, you’d think that this would have made him a millionaire; it didn’t. Radio stations at that time had invested enormous amounts of money in the old technology. So the last thing they wanted was to invest millions more in the new technology. Nor did they want to have to compete with other radio stations that had a superior sound and could put them out of business. So they pressured the Federal Communications Commission, the department of the United States government that regulates radio stations, to put restrictive regulations on FM radio. The result was that its use was limited to a very small area around New England. Of course as we all know, Edwin Armstrong’s FM technology eventually prevailed and was adopted by thousands of stations around the world. But this took years of court battles and he never saw how it came to affect the lives of almost everyone. 88I’m going to talk about a train that exemplifies the rise and fall of passenger trains in the United States: the Twentieth Century Limited. Let me go back just a bit. In 1893, a special train was established to take people from New York to an exposition in Chicago. It was so successful that regular service was then set up between these cities. The inaugural trip of the Twentieth Century Limited was made in 1902. The train was different from what anyone had ever seen before. It was pulled by a steam engine and had five cars: two sleepers, a dining car, an observation car, and a baggage car, which, believe it or not, contained a library. The 42 passengers the train could carry were waited on by a large staff. There were even secretaries and a barber on board. It wasn’t long before people had to wait two years to get a reservation. As time passed, technical improvements shortened the trip by a few hours. Perhaps the biggest technological change occurred in 1945, the switch from steam to diesel engines. By the 1960’s, people were traveling by car and airplane. Unfortunately, the great old train didn’t survive until the end of the century it was named for. 89I understand your professor has been discussing several Eastern Woodland Indian tribes in your study of Native American cultures. As you have probably learned, the Eastern Woodland Indians get their name from the forest-covered areas of the Eastern United States where they lived. The earliest Woodland cultures date back 9,000 years, but the group we’ll focus on dates back only to about 700 A.D. We now call these Native Americans the Mississippian culture, because they settled in the Mississippi River valley. This civilization is known for its flat-topped monuments called temple mounds. They were made of earth and used as temples and official residences. The temple mounds were located in the central square of the city, with the huts of the townspeople built in rows around the plaza. The Mississippian people were city dwellers. But some city residents earned their living as farmers, tending the fields of corn, beans, and squash that surrounded the city. The city’s artisans made arrowheads, leather goods, pottery, and jewelry. Traders came from far away to exchange raw materials for these items. In the slides I’m about to show, you will see models of a Mississippian city. 90As Dr. Miller mentioned, we’re trying to recruit volunteers for the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary. But before I get into the details of the volunteer program, I’d just like to tell you a little about what we do there. One of our main jobs is to keep detailed records of the migration patterns of raptors. For those of you who don’t know, raptors are birds of prey, like hawks and eagles. Between August and December, we see around twenty different species migrating from Canada and New England. About 20,000 birds. Part of what attracts them to Hawk Mountain is the location on the East Ridge of the Appalachian Mountains. What happens is that the sun warms the ridge in such a way that air currents are formed. The birds just sort of glide along on the air, so they use up very little energy. As volunteers, you’ll be helping us keep accurate counts of the raptors. Any drop in number could mean something’s gone wrong in the environment because of pesticides or disease, even hunting. We just had a scare with the broad-winged hawks. Their numbers have dropped drastically over the last ten years. It was suggested that the birds may have changed their migratory route. So for 11 days we had several hundred volunteers—stationed every five miles—to observe and count. And sure enough, they discovered that instead of hugging the Appalachians as they’d always done, the broad-wings were cutting a wide path over the Delaware River. Needless to say, we were greatly relieved. 91Everyone is interested in improving their diet. Adding grains is one of the easiest ways. Many people in the United States have a growing concern about nutrition, so grains are often served in restaurants. And many grains are now available in grocery stores, too, though for some you still have to go to health food stores. You can stock up when you go, though, because uncooked grains keep a long time. You’ll find that grains are easy to prepare. Many grains are as simple to cook as spaghetti. Barley, for instance, is just cooked in salted water. Remember, though, whole-grain barley, the most nutritious kind, never will get as tender as spaghetti no matter how long it’s cooked. Grain-based salads are easy, too. Just use grains left over from a hot meal. You call even put together a grain salad hours before you need it, since grains don’t wilt like lettuce does. But to get back to health factors, all grains are nutritious and many have special benefits. Barley has very little fat. Some experts believe that it may even reduce cholesterol levels. Jasmine rice is also low in fat. And it has a bonus in its wonderful aroma, a very special fragrance. 92Well, in answer to your question, several women actively participated in the Civil War. The one that comes immediately to mind is Mary Walker. She’s important because she’s the only woman ever to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. As you know, this medal is given to people who’ve served the United States with exceptional bravery. In addition, she was the only female physician in either of the two armies that fought in that war. Even though she had two medical degrees, many officers made her life difficult because they didn’t believe that a woman should be a doctor. However, she refused to back down and leave the army. In fact, she risked her life several times during the war and was even captured at one point, but she was soon released. Umm, after the war, she was arrested several times for wearing pants. And although Congress eventually tried to take her medal away, she refused to give it back and continued to wear it wherever she went. She died in 1919, a year before women received the right to vote, which brings me to my next point. 93So, you see, physical illness can have psychological causes. Now, we just have time to introduce another interesting example of the interaction between the mind and the body, placebos. Placebos—maybe you’ve heard them called sugar pills—are harmless substances, not always sugar, that are used routinely on groups of sick people in experiments. These experiments test the effectiveness of new drugs. One group is given the new drug, the other group is given a placebo, and the results are measured. As you might guess, some of the people who receive the new drug get better. Surprisingly, however, some of the placebo group also get better. Why? Well, it’s an interesting question, one which doctors can’t quite answer. Some of the group may have gotten better on their own, without any treatment at all, but research has shown that the very act of taking a medication that you think will make you better, often does make you feel better. Have you ever taken an aspirin and felt better in five minutes? Aspirin doesn’t work that fast, does it? Basically, if you believe you will get better, sometimes you do. The history of how doctors and healers have used the mind-body connection to cure people is long and interesting, but I see that it’s time to chose, so I’ll have to cover this in the next class. You’ll have to hold your questions on this topic till then. Before you go, I have some handouts for you concerning the midterm exams next week."},{"title":"","date":"2024-06-05T04:40:50.077Z","updated":"2024-04-04T13:33:58.908Z","comments":true,"path":"Report/index.html","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/Report/index.html","excerpt":"","text":"市场研报

800万的证券账户余额，真的吗？这也是平凡？？ 我做了一个很简单的收入模型，一个人25岁开始有了收入，从第一年12万，到45岁。这个收入模型能做到的也不是很普遍。结果最终在45岁的时候，总收入也就1100多万。所以有800万的证券资产可真的不是平凡人。 可能是短剧看多了，又或者是在每平10万的办公室呆久了。不看自己余额的时候，觉得2万一平的房子似乎还行，30万的一辆车好像也不算多。 也许人的思维惯性受到成长的环境影响，说说我熟悉的工价。 竹子，在农村大约是20 元一旦（100斤），一位工人一天大概可以砍25旦，每日的酬劳大约是200元，工作时间是6：00 到17：00。绿茶，市价200多一斤的干茶，一位工人一天大概可以采2.5斤干茶，工人工资150到200 元（一般妇女偏多，工价稍微便宜），工作时间是6：00 到17：00。 茶季一年20天，如果能坚持20天，不得腰肌劳损的唯一前提就是还年轻。砍竹子一个月最多做20天，即使你有精力，还要考虑天气。结论是：普通农民一年净收入3万，算不错了。这大约是合肥市不到2平米的房子。 “不能总是说农村的收入情况，务工就会不同了”，作为曾经不专业的数据分析师，参见以前的文章 ，毕竟自己也在其中，心里清楚的很。我很少和人说这些，一是和大环境似乎不符，再是未免太负面，悲观。另外我也在辩解，只有悲观的视角才能感受到真实。当你觉得这个世界不是美好的，那你拥有的任何小美好都会感受的更加真切。 我在休假期间，和当地一个公益组织参加了他们的救助贫困学生的回访活动。作为成员，也是第一次，听老成员说他们第一次拜访的经历，有人说到 ”我真的不敢相信还有这么穷的人，什么年代了“ “第一次见到xx时，你不知道哦，又黑又矮又瘦，一句话都不敢讲” “你们不知道，那是我第一次见识到什么是家徒四壁” 老实说，我对这种形容并无期待，也知道大概什么样，不说体会过，但肯定见到过。只是这些真实很少能在公众平台看见，或者能看见，却很难看清。这也是现实的魔幻。 我们到了一个姐妹家里，姐姐刚好考上大学，妹妹在读初中。母亲趁着不忙的空隙骑着电瓶车从打工的饭店里赶来。没有一个人有刻意的言语或者动作，稀疏平常的话却也有振人的力量。 “孩子他爸去透析了，应该快回来了” “两个女儿供出来就行了” “看看明年去县里陪读，刚好再找一个工作，现在这里工资太低了” 走的时候，组织的发起人对小女孩说：”有一位很好的阿姨单独捐助你，你们有联系吗？她很喜欢你，如果你有空也和阿姨发个信息问候下“。 我知道这里更多的是担心一个孩子不敢表达她的感激，是的，是担心不敢表达而不是意识不到。 我曾经也是因为斜视而让自己变得封闭，我很感谢初中班主任帮我解了很多次的围，那时候我知道她在保护我，可我不曾说过感谢，一是表达必然会打开自己的伤疤，二是羞于表达。 我忍不住还是放出这张图片，稚嫩的笑容是多么天真，美丽。我也觉得考上了本科院校很不容易。 当然四年后也有以下现实，将有1500 万的毕业生一起竞争，房价可能是实习工资的10倍。算了，不想再残忍了。 但是不告诉真相，不代表真相不存在。 这世界有很多幸运儿，但是均值回归，正态分布，这些都告诉你，那就是少数。也许有多金之人沾沾自喜，也诚恳点，因为你多出的收入是别人未来的负债。我这里引用《经济解释》的一个例子 ”话说有一群人，每个都是白痴，对世事茫然不解。经济学者却假设他们每个人明智地争取最大的利益。事实上，这些人都是白痴，所以这个经济假设显然是错了。这些白痴听说汽油站很好玩，于是每个人都开办油站了。因为是白痴，他们之中有些把油站建在荒山之上，有些建在密林之中，也有些建在海上的。没有公路汽车经过，油站怎可生存呢？但他们当中有几个同样的白痴，却胡里胡涂地把油站建在公路旁。过不了多久，适者生存，不适者淘汰，只有在公路旁建油站的白痴能生存。事实上，他们是不知自己所为的。经济学者假设他们懂得怎样争取最大利益，显然是错了的，但留存下来的油站，却刚刚与争取最大利益的假设不谋而合。假设白痴懂得怎样争取利益虽然是错了，但却准确地推测了白痴建油站在公路旁的行为，这些行为于是就被解释了。说他们不知所为，所以油站不会建在最有利可图的地方，是谬论。“- 张五常. 经济解释 四卷本 (Kindle Locations 347-354). Kindle Edition. 可能并不恰当，意思是，即使一堆白痴也会有幸运儿，但你不能证明有幸运儿是努力的结果。 我也尝试做了收入分配，以及投资组合。搞笑的事情来了，测算的时候发现：当收入足够低的时候，完全没有意义了，朋友提醒我你所谓的固定那项不就是恩格尔系数嘛。让五千一个月的人投资？那不如直接买彩票。我们知道鸡蛋不要放在一个篮子里，可是你只有一个鸡蛋的时候怎么办呢？ 大学老师跟我说过，宏观看待问题，微观分析问题。宏观的来说，不要被幸运儿的故事带焦虑了。围观来说，你只有一个鸡蛋的时候，第一个问题是多下几个蛋。 最终，你成为不了那个幸运儿，你的平凡也是剧本，接受他（作为2024第一篇博客，强行点题了）","categories":[{"name":"Personal","slug":"Personal","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/categories/Personal/"}],"tags":[{"name":"share","slug":"share","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/share/"}]},{"title":"紀念劉上豪老師","slug":"farewelltw","date":"2023-10-07T21:14:00.000Z","updated":"2024-04-07T17:55:38.919Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/10/07/farewelltw/","link":"","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/2023/10/07/farewelltw/","excerpt":"立題卻難執筆2023年10月4日，下午約2點，朋友圈看到很不好的消息，讓我猛地驚醒的是那張再也熟悉不過的照片。那一瞬間大腦似乎宕機了，難道這是做夢，怎麼會呢？

”劉老師的事情你知道嗎？” …. 所有人對他的評價都是，沒有傲氣，和善，努力。並為此遺憾 我關閉了慣有的Messenger 勿擾模式，期待著奇蹟發生。10月5號晚，真的看到老師在線了，理智告訴我，這不是本人，或者是系統的BUG。但還是試著發了一個消息，表達自己的所想。對面開始閃動，師母林老師回了我： 親愛的雲飛每個人都有各自的使命他完成了就會轉身對劉老師來說他是華麗的完美的轉身我沒有恨…我感恩著

幫老師轉達讓其他同學知道老師生命的意義還有師母也一直陪伴在你們的生命中有什麼話想說都能傳微信給我我會一個一個好好回覆大家 善良，感恩，謙虛，向上 生命或許很脆弱，但生命的價值卻可以很大很大。 我翻了所有的相冊，腦子裡回閃了所有的會議。並記下這一切。 初識劉老師2016年9月，安徽理工大學老校區的校園小道兩旁梧桐落葉開始堆積，淮南的天氣很冷，不經意間的風吹過來已經有了一股冬天的味道。化工學院彈藥實驗樓是兩層的筒子樓，周圍全是參天的梧桐樹，遠遠看去實驗室被樹群包裹在中間。 有一天學院教授說帶我去聚餐，在學院門口集合時候，剛好看到學門口梧桐樹下站著一對男女，看上去不像學生但很年輕且彬彬有禮。 教授和他們打起招呼，似乎是要和我們一起同行。上車以後聽他們對話才知道這是從台灣遠道而來的博士。即和教授一起，又是遇到不同地域的陌生人，本不善言辭的我一句話也沒說。我只知道這位陌生的年輕人是我們學院的新老師，姓劉。 吃飯期間，教授繪聲繪色地聊當地美食，淮南文化。看著劉老師局促地頻頻點頭，那一刻倒真覺得我們有點相似。突然劉老師離席想去廁所，我便帶著他繞了三圈八里找到，兩個人在廁所回來的路上才開始有了對話。 他問我什麼專業，大幾的學生，我問他覺得這裡怎麼樣爾爾。第一次現實中聽到台灣腔總是讓我出戲，不過因為模樣年輕，反而沒有芥蒂，直到加了微信，此時才知道他的全名叫“劉上豪” 老師和我經常把這一段稱為“廁所情緣”，經常打趣到。 認識“Layout”和重視英語正式認識以後，開始並沒有太多交流，在我心裡人家毕竟是老師。有一天他突然約我一起吃午饭，就在學校的食堂裡我們一起聊了更多東西。於是我想著可以先帶著他爬爬舜耕山，提出建議後，老師欣然接受。 一路上老師開心的聊著他學生時代發生的故事，像一個學長一樣。偶爾也感嘆，學生時光要好好珍惜。印象最深的是他無數次提到他自己的導師，眉飛色舞地講述著他實驗室的故事。 “雲飛，你知道嗎？我的老師為了讓我們提高英語就非常嚴格，譬如，每次去機場接他。我們都會為了表現自己把車子的CD改成英文收音機。然後開著的時候，老師會突然來一句，上豪，剛才那個單詞是什麼意思？” 接著補一句語氣 “靠，當時真的很無語哎” 但眼睛里還是可以看出他非常非常喜歡他的老師。 最終到達山頂的涼亭，涼亭上被刻的滿滿當當的“xxxx到此一遊”，我們兩個都注意到彼此看到了這些，神情上都略顯尷尬。 師母林老師則在一旁熱情地打開她的書包，拿出了水果一起分享，如果沒記錯應該是皮削的非常乾淨，排的整整齊齊的哈密瓜。作為回饋，我拿出了名叫“台灣香腸”的零食，還笑著問道這是不是台灣的特色呀。 下山的時候，我們在休息時候，旁邊是介紹景色的景區牌，內容無從記起，應該是景區圖，上面還有英語注釋。老師指了指句子中出現的“layout”，說到”工廠裡的機器布局，也叫layout，如果你上班肯定會經常接觸到這個詞匯“。 我也不知道當時自己記不記得layout， 心裡想著就是，英語這個話題我肯定聊不下去，因為大學是沒怎麼用過的。劉老師似乎注意到我不太愿意討論英語問題，他低聲的說道”英語真的非常重要啦，現在年輕一定要好好學“ 我已經不記得下山后，我們有沒有一起吃飯。或者說我們一起吃過很多飯，但是我不知道對應著下山的那一次有沒有存在過。 第二周的周一，中午他讓我去他辦公室，他給我拿出一本打印的很厚的英語單詞本。他說我可以開始背這些單詞。好似之后每認識一位新同學他都會把同樣的單詞本送給他。 我不能說那一刻我開始重視英語，但當時確實對老師的“用心”很感動。 有了自己的座位我不記得何時我有了自己的座位，只知道老師說給我安排好座位后，我是十分的驚喜，驚訝 1，默默無聞的我從來沒有被如此重視 2，這個座位我該怎麼利用，毕竟图书馆都沒去過幾次 從此去辦公室就成了每天的工作，當然為了多睡會，我偶爾也會撒謊早上有課而不去。老師也許也知道但並沒有拆穿。起初並沒有特別多的事情，無非看看課件。做的最多的好像也就起幫老師整理流程圖但Word文檔。 胸無大志，又沒考研究生的打算，或者太笨拙，老師想帶也無從下手，最先給我講的是關於期刊，會議，論文的區別。說來諷刺，這些最最基礎的知識對本科生來說也是難以接觸到的。 有一天我們一起從校外吃完晚飯回來，路上只有我和劉老師兩個人，他問我工作是不是找好了，我說是的,去福建。老師平靜的說道“有機會的話，還是建議你繼續讀書”。當時我並不以為意，只是覺得站在老師角度這樣思考或者建議是正常的。 當然，再細小的一句話，當你感受到的關心足夠，也會慢慢地長出一顆種子。一周一周的過去，偶爾逃課，偶爾裝成好學生，有時候還能被教授“邀請”幫忙做炸藥。日子倒也很充實，劉老師的辦公室便是我除了寢室的第二個家，有空調，有咖啡，有免費的大顯示器。 慢慢知道了期刊數據庫“science direct”，也知道了學校的虛擬圖書館價值有多麼大。於是開始了搜關鍵詞看期刊內容的工作。我想如果英語有一點長進，那也是從劈頭蓋臉的讀期刊開始。 比起這些學術上的涉足，印象里最開心的還是老師愛不釋手的咖啡機，他會問我知不知道卡布奇洛，拿鐵，摩卡的區別，然后饒有興致的說起牛奶和咖啡的配比。那時候我對咖啡機直接打出來的咖啡接受度很低，第一杯咖啡我是捏著鼻子當中藥喝完， 然後當天讓我直到凌晨三點才入眠。 一起去法國“我一定要帶你們出去看看” 老師的這句話，我印象裡一定聽過10遍以上。 雖然現在去某個國家似乎不再是稀奇的事情。但是在大學期間能出國一次確實是莫大的榮耀，它意味著 第一次辦護照 第一次辦申根簽 第一次坐飛機（人生第一次） 第一次出國 第一次和老外說英語 … 有一天，老師神神秘秘的拿了一個藥瓶子，問我：“雲飛，你猜這個多少錢？”，他笑起來還挺像個學生的。當時我也不知道或許那算是第一次接觸到綠色離子 我拿過來瞅了瞅，直接的一串很長的英文名，下面一個CAS編號。只搞過乳化炸藥的我是當然不知道了，我就問“是不是很貴” 他沒繼續賣關子，悠悠的說到 “台幣是8000 多，這就是我最近做的熱危害分析的物質”，隨後便給我發了一篇文章，讓我先閱讀一番。 我應該是讀了，順便還拿了一本書，綠色的封面，繁體字。 類似的零碎事情，事情中夾雜著解釋，解釋後夾雜著疑惑。知道有一條老師發了一個截圖，綠色主題的郵件大概寫的是congratulations, 他說會議投稿通過了，可以準備去法國了，他當時還不知道對我來說去法國連護照都要開始辦。 邀請函 擔保證明 自薦信 …尤其是擔保證明，父母都是農民，哪裡弄銀行流水？ “沒事，你用我的” 我也不知道折騰了多久，簽證是提交了，但是能不能下是個未知數。 直到出發當天，簽證還沒有下來，而且根據規定，你只有拿到護照後才知道是拒簽還是通過。 “沒事，你先帶好行李，跟著我” 我們先去了南京工業大學調研，準備從南京到上海乘飛機，那時候我不覺得有什麼希望，背著個書包跟在後面。 中午吃飯了，簽證中心還沒有消息，老師也不時問我，然後安慰道：“沒事啦，只要你簽證沒問題，就一定要過去。加入時間來不及，我今晚先飛，到時候機場接你就行了” 我只是猶豫還要去上海嗎？ “先去吧，不行你就當上海旅遊了” 大概下午2點，去上海的高鐵上，我得到消息，簽證過了。 回想，無比感恩。 一路上，我像個好奇的孩子，畢竟第一次。老師介紹機型，坐飛機不同位置感受，我希望當時老師會對自己帶一個廢物出遊感到由衷的開心! “我說了，我一定要帶你們出去看看” 巴黎呆一晚後我們便緊緊出發去會議地點La Rochelle, 拉羅謝爾地處法國的南邊，最不巧的是老師因為時差加之法國的氣候太寒冷感冒了。我們乘坐的是flixbus，全程大約花了6個小時，因為感冒發燒老師似乎眼睛都沒睜一下。 種種而而，無以言表，如果沒有這些，我的人生會少了更多色彩。這些離不開老師。 工作後的相聚最後一次見到劉老師是2021年的12月份。從2018年回國匆匆見完一次之後，後面疫情或許只是我的保護傘，一直未見更大的原因是覺得自己無所成就。或許沒有人願意讓自己看重的人失望。 2022年1月1號，趁著放假鼓起勇氣回到母校。因為假期學校冷冷清清。或許這是對我們這些普通非傑出校友最大的關愛。心裡一直暗示自己”我是看劉老師而已”。 兩位沒有回家的研究生，我們一起聊了聊關於工作，甚至他們帶我參觀了龐大的實驗室。我真的沒想到，短短幾年，老師已經把實驗室打造成了如此。以至於他告訴我已經是教授的時候，完全沒有驚訝。只能感嘆老師爬山爬得太快了，以至於我還在山底找路，他已經從一座山頭到了另一座山頭。 老師單獨和我聊了很多，他的計劃，回台灣，去美國或者加拿大。更多就是鼓勵我出去走走。 難以回頭望 就此搁筆

一路上老师开心的聊着他学生时代发生的故事，像一个学长一样。偶尔也感叹，学生时光要好好珍惜。印象最深的是他无数次提到他自己的导师，眉飞色舞地讲述着他实验室的故事。 “云飞，你知道吗？我的老师为了让我们提高英语就非常严格，譬如，每次去机场接他。我们都会为了表现自己把车子的CD改成英文收音机。然后开着的时候，老师会突然来一句，上豪，刚才那个单词是什么意思？” 接着补一句语气 “靠，当时真的很无语哎” 但眼睛里还是可以看出他非常非常喜欢他的老师。 最终到达山顶的凉亭，凉亭上被刻的满满当当的“xxxx到此一游”，我们两个都注意到彼此看到了这些，神情上都略显尴尬。 师母林老师则在一旁热情地打开她的书包，拿出了水果一起分享，如果没记错应该是皮削的非常干净，排的整整齐齐的哈密瓜。作为回馈，我拿出了名叫“台湾香肠”的零食，还笑着问道这是不是台湾的特色呀。 下山的时候，我们在休息时候，旁边是介绍景色的景区牌，内容无从记起，应该是景区图，上面还有英语注释。老师指了指句子中出现的“layout”，说到”工厂里的机器布局，也叫layout，如果你上班肯定会经常接触到这个词汇“。 我也不知道当时自己记不记得layout， 心里想着就是，英语这个话题我肯定聊不下去，因为大学是没怎么用过的。刘老师似乎注意到我不太愿意讨论英语问题，他低声的说道”英语真的非常重要啦，现在年轻一定要好好学“ 我已经不记得下山后，我们有没有一起吃饭。或者说我们一起吃过很多饭，但是我不知道对应着下山的那一次有没有存在过。 第二周的周一，中午他让我去他办公室，他给我拿出一本打印的很厚的英语单词本。他说我可以开始背这些单词。好似之后每认识一位新同学他都会把同样的单词本送给他。 我不能说那一刻我开始重视英语，但当时确实对老师的“用心”很感动。 有了自己的座位我不记得何时我有了自己的座位，只知道老师说给我安排好座位后，我是十分的惊喜，惊讶 1，默默无闻的我从来没有被如此重视 2，这个座位我该怎么利用，毕竟图书馆都没去过几次 从此去办公室就成了每天的工作，当然为了多睡会，我偶尔也会撒谎早上有课而不去。老师也许也知道，但并没有拆穿。起初并没有特别多的事情，无非看看课件。做的最多的好像也就起帮老师整理流程图但Word文档。 胸无大志，又没考研究生的打算，或者太笨拙，老师想带也无从下手，最先给我讲的是关于期刊，会议，论文的区别。说来讽刺，这些最最基础的知识对本科生来说也是难以接触到的。 有一天我们一起从校外吃完晚饭回来，路上只有我和刘老师两个人，他问我工作是不是找好了，我说是的。准备去福建做爆破工程师。老师平静的说道“有机会的话，还是建议你继续读书”。当时我并不以为意，只是觉得站在老师角度这样思考或者建议是正常的。 后来当我确认过去实习的时候，老师问过我薪资，我说3500 元 老师说：“我觉得有点低啦，或许5000 元还可以接受，不如继续读书啦” 当然，再细小的一句话，当你感受到的关心足够，也会慢慢地长出一颗种子。一周一周的过去，偶尔逃课，偶尔装成好学生，有时候还能被教授“邀请”帮忙做炸药。日子倒也很充实，刘老师的办公室便是我除了寝室的第二个家，有空调，有咖啡，有免费的大显示器。 慢慢知道了期刊数据库“science direct”，也知道了学校的虚拟图书馆价值有多么大。于是开始了搜关键词看期刊内容的工作。我想如果英语有一点长进，那也是从劈头盖脸的读期刊开始。 比起这些学术上的涉足，印象里最开心的还是老师爱不释手的咖啡机，他会问我知不知道卡布奇洛，拿铁，摩卡的区别，然后饶有兴致的说起牛奶和咖啡的配比。那时候我对咖啡机直接打出来的咖啡接受度很低，第一杯咖啡我是捏着鼻子当中药喝完， 并且当天让我直到凌晨三点才入眠。 一起去法国“我一定要带你们出去看看” 老师的这句话，我印象里一定听过10遍以上。 虽然现在去某个国家似乎不再是稀奇的事情。但是在大学期间能出国一次确实是莫大的荣耀，它意味着 第一次办护照 第一次办申根签 第一次坐飞机（人生第一次） 第一次出国 第一次和老外说英语 … 有一天，老师神神秘秘的拿了一个药瓶子，问我：“云飞，你猜这个多少钱？”，他笑起来还挺象个学生的。当时我也不知道或许那算是第一次接触到绿色离子 我拿过来瞅了瞅，直接的一串很长的英文名，下面一个CAS编号。只搞过乳化炸药的我是当然不知道了，我就问“是不是很贵” 他没继续卖关子，悠悠的说到 “台币是8000 多，这就是我最近做的热危害分析的物质”，随后便给我发了一篇文章，让我先阅读一番。 我应该是读了，顺便还拿了一本书，绿色的封面，繁体字。 类似的零碎事情，事情中夹杂着解释，解释后夹杂着疑惑。知道有一条老师发了一个截图，绿色主题的邮件大概写的是congratulations, 他说会议投稿通过了，可以准备去法国了，他当时还不知道对我来说去法国连护照都要开始办。 邀请函 担保证明 自荐信 … 尤其是担保证明，父母都是农民，哪里弄银行流水？ “没事，你用我的” 我也不知道折腾了多久，签证是提交了，但是能不能下是个未知数。 直到出发当天，签证还没有下来，而且根据规定，你只有拿到护照后才知道是拒签还是通过。 “没事，你先带好行李，跟着我” 我们先去了南京工业大学调研，准备从南京到上海乘飞机，那时候我不觉得有什么希望，背着个书包跟在后面。 中午吃饭了，签证中心还没有消息，老师也不时问我，然后安慰道：“没事啦，只要你签证没问题，就一定要过去。加入时间来不及，我今晚先飞，到时候机场接你就行了” 我只是犹豫还要去上海吗？ “先去吧，不行你就当上海旅游了” 大概下午2点，去上海的高铁上，我得到消息，签证过了。 回想，无比感恩。 一路上，我像个好奇的孩子，毕竟第一次。老师介绍机型，坐飞机不同位置感受，我希望当时老师会对自己带一个废物出游感到由衷的开心! “我说了，我一定要带你们出去看看” 巴黎呆一晚后我们便紧紧出发去会议地点La Rochelle, 拉罗谢尔地处法国的南边，最不巧的是老师因为时差加之法国的气候太寒冷感冒了。我们乘坐的是flixbus，全程大约花了6个小时，因为感冒发烧老师似乎眼睛都没睁一下。 种种而而，无以言表，如果没有这些，我的人生会少了更多色彩。这些离不开老师。 工作后的相聚最后一次见到刘老师是2021年的12月份。从2018年回国匆匆见完一次之后，后面疫情或许只是我的保护伞，一直未见更大的原因是觉得自己无所成就。或许没有人愿意让自己看重的人失望。 2022年1月1号，趁着放假鼓起勇气回到母校。因为假期学校冷冷清清。或许这是对我们这些普通非杰出校友最大的关爱。心里一直暗示自己”我是看刘老师而已“。 两位没有回家的研究生，我们一起聊了聊关于工作，甚至他们带我参观了庞大的实验室。我真的没想到，短短几年，老师已经把实验室打造成了如此。以至于他告诉我已经是教授的时候，完全没有惊讶。只能感叹老师爬山爬得太快了，以至于我还在山底找路，他已经从一座山头到了另一座山头。 老师单独和我聊了很多，他的计划，回台湾，去美国或者加拿大。更多就是鼓励我出去走走。 难以回头望 就此搁笔

window.open(yandexSearchUrl, '_blank'); } }); }); 信息检索是一门独立的课程，里面对信息的检索有非常系统的概述。我这种学渣是做不到对那么大的框架做提炼。 因为在类互联网行业待过，自以为在信息检索方面比一般人会稍微强一点点，偶尔与人沟通时也会聊到关于信息查询方面的知识，写这篇文字一是感叹于这种捅破窗户纸的东西还是有人不知道，二是有的人竟然认为这层窗户纸比愚公移山还难。诚然，每个人的世界都是局限的，这是个哲学问题，我无法探讨。但是打破信息茧房并不是那么困难，只需要使用一点点技巧，了解一点点知识，我们的搜索能力就能大步提高。 注意，检索到信息，它最核心的作用的打破信息茧房，这不代表你具备了信息描述的能力，比如你可以轻松搜索到单片机的设计工艺，但不代表你真的会设计单片机。检索信息仅仅提供了可能性的基础。 在这里我先不谈正在爆发的技术会带来的革新，先从最简单的逻辑说起，信息检索我把它白话成以下几步 确认你的问题 知道信息大概存在于哪里 不停接近这个信息，判断信息并且缩小它所在的范围 获得信息 1，确认与分解问题是的，第一步似乎和检索没有任何关系，但是大部分人检索不到信息，是因为他压根就不知道自己的“问题”是什么。 很可能你一直以来的提问方式就是错的，你的真正的“问题”不一定是你过去的“提问方式下的问题” 比如：如果想提高英语（提高代表你有英语基础），我去检索“如何提高英语”。相信绝大部分是广告，其次可能是匹配度不高的信息，比如你想提高的是口语，展示的信息却是对英语的写作。 也就是说，你的一个不恰当的问题，会出现80%的不相关结果，在不停地筛查中，你会放弃，因为一个不爱明确提出具体问题的人往往也没耐心去筛选信息。 那么，先要确认你要提高英语的哪个点，这时候你会发现有两种情况： 你只是受环境影响，你的某个同事浏览英文网站被你看到了，所谓想提高英语仅仅是因为从众心理，实际上你压根就不想提高英语。 你学习英语是因为你的岗位也很多英文咨询，所以先了解跟自己行业相关的英语网站可以帮自己解决工作问题。你就可以开始分解这个宏观的问题 有哪些英文类的咨询网站 看这些网站你面临哪些困难，把每一个困难变成一个问题 如果是第一种，那你大可不必做一个虎头蛇尾的事情，眼下你可能有更加重要紧急的事情需要去处理。 如果是第二种，比起“如何提高英语”，你把问题定位到了“xxx行业的英文类资讯网站有哪些”，同时对一个宏观的问题做了拆解。 这里可能会反驳，这和提高英语有关系吗？那你不妨再问自己一句，提高英语干嘛呢？你是信仰英语吗？无所指代的问题，只配得到无法应用的答案。 2，知道信息存在于哪里我自己把信息分为，广泛传播的，未广泛传播的 广泛传播的信息 学术资源，如书籍，期刊，论文 新闻媒体评论 博客，论坛 高校，企业，政府，无政府组织，公益官网 未广泛传播的 细分领域的圈层信息 会所，部分协会等内部资料 涉及隐私或不具备广泛传播特征的信息，如：小企业的财务状况，你喜欢的女孩子是不是单身 对于广泛传播的信息，似乎比较贴切我们的主题。而未广泛传播的更加适合于身体力行，但是似乎逻辑都是一致的。 如果你的问题是“某某女孩是否单身” 1，确认问题是什么，“xxx是否单身”2，这个事情，她自己必然知道，其次可能他的身边朋友3，接近她的朋友或者直接找到她，侧面打听4，你会得到一些列回答，再进行判断 当然，这种未广泛传播的信息，更多的是需要社交方案，自己的平台及形象。并且未广泛传播的信息本身可能不具备合法性，比如你如果想了解竞争公司的财务状况去贿赂人家的财务，就已经踏进牢房半步了。另外还有暗网，黑产如社工库这些，都是非法的。 3，接近与获得信息这里要做两个假设前提，当然，即使这样你也能处理99%的信息获取壁垒了 1，你需要的信息是广泛传播的信息2，你具备条件检索到它（特指技术层面，如权限，防火墙等） 如何接近信息呢？1，将拆解的问题，分步搜索，比如：搜索信息所在的地方，回到案例1，我们先得到了一些英文行业资讯【确定了信息存在于哪里】。2，你发现很多单词非常陌生，那你的问题就是“某某行业的英文术语”，因为你甚至这些可能是书籍的形式出现，那你可以通过搜索技巧“某某行业的英文术语 filetype:pdf”。这样出来的结果就是PDF的文件，内容关于“某某行业的英文术语”。3，你发现单词量太多了，你认识的不到10%，那你就需要思考如何”背单词“，所以你可以搜索”背单词的常见方法“。4，或者你需要注重发音，那你就需要去查询发音，但是一个个查询太慢了，那你可以搜索”单词的发音规律“，也可以”单词的发音规律 filetype:pdf“。5，你可能会重新接触到音标，那么思考下”音标是发音“，所以你明确这个信息会存在于视频中，所以你开始搜索视频”英语音标教程“ 综合，你从一个提高英语的问题（似乎非常宽泛），根据你的实际背景拆分了以下步骤 1，找到你要解决的问题【行业英文咨询】2，导向第二个信息【行业的英文术语】3，导向第三个信息【背单词的常见方法】4，导向第四个信息【单词的发音规律】 …. 这个过程就是接近你想要的信息（为了解决问题），是的，他不是独立的一个信息，而是一系列的信息等你分布消化，且这个过程并非发生在一瞬间，而是和你互动。","categories":[{"name":"Personal","slug":"Personal","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/categories/Personal/"}],"tags":[{"name":"share","slug":"share","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/share/"},{"name":"tools","slug":"tools","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/tools/"}]},{"title":"旧记事","slug":"Bgp003","date":"2023-07-28T22:00:00.000Z","updated":"2024-04-07T17:52:54.908Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/07/29/Bgp003/","link":"","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/2023/07/29/Bgp003/","excerpt":"关于对与错-文章写于2018年4月站在最高点，什么话都可以说，我甚至想大尿一泡，康德不是名字带有“德”就一定说道德，但人家说的“真理批判”真的离世人太远了。秦晖提过“伪善不可怕，就怕伪恶”，伪恶：心中想做好事，但是怕做了别人也不相信，甚至被怀疑另有动机，而选择从恶的现象。洛克提出过基本的文明底线，你我都在边缘吊儿郎当，边际却是递减。你睁大双眼，不敢相信怎么会有这么恶心的事情，转眼你又是另一个相同故事的主角。","text":"关于对与错-文章写于2018年4月站在最高点，什么话都可以说，我甚至想大尿一泡，康德不是名字带有“德”就一定说道德，但人家说的“真理批判”真的离世人太远了。秦晖提过“伪善不可怕，就怕伪恶”，伪恶：心中想做好事，但是怕做了别人也不相信，甚至被怀疑另有动机，而选择从恶的现象。洛克提出过基本的文明底线，你我都在边缘吊儿郎当，边际却是递减。你睁大双眼，不敢相信怎么会有这么恶心的事情，转眼你又是另一个相同故事的主角。 你我都是粪坑的蛆虫 都等着一天变成苍蝇 当你蜕变飞起 不要忘记你曾钻过的洞眼 那里芬芳馥郁 天空污浊空气 你跑到你喜欢的地方 满意，满意 滋滋充满生命的腹部 又是一波一波的蛆 蠕动蠕动 直到出现了马桶 说到“马桶”，感谢它的普及让我在黑夜里不再和直肠作斗争. 所有的“作文”都是止于“升华”，尤其是文章的最后一段，“升华”成了所有文章的终极定义。没有感悟哪里算得上故事，哪怕是编的……话说现在编故事也得需要点诱惑吧。我们总说是是非非谁能无过，是非对错很难明了，其实有勇气去弄明白吗？ 有时候把事情弄得不明不白因为自己也会心虚，能心虚是上等货色了……我们总是把所有人都会犯错变成了自己犯错不用改正的上好理由。对，逻辑，逻辑可是个奢侈品，不同的是奢侈品钱可以买到。 “对”和“错”究竟是什么呢？“小孩子才分对错，大人分“利弊”。有时候我觉得这句话太对了，哪有什么对错，纳什点还没能解释吗？ 但是怪就怪在：对错，利弊根本就是不同概念呀。 “对错”的判断标准，上为道德，底线为法律，或解释为原则。 “利弊”是行为的结果对某行为人本身或其目标产生的影响。行为可以是对的，可以是错的。可以是合法的抑或非法。 显然，只谈“利弊”不讲“对错”可以解释今天看到的很多事情。 我们听不得“我是一个有原则的人”这样的话术，确实，“有原则”不就是基本的道德观吗？倘若这都成了可以炫耀的资本，世人耻笑不也是应该…我特别喜欢夸夸其谈，所以何为对，何未错是不适合夸夸其谈的人去定义的 备注（2021）：坦白而言，我也不知道这段要表达什么，也许是年少的造作的，记录下来也好。2023 回头看，年轻时候还有点东西，现在就特么知道吃喝拉撒了，还赚不到几毛钱 我想象的教育成长-文章写于 2018年6月 如果小学就被启发去主动了解这个世界是怎么分布,怎么构造的。 比如这样我在这里，但我能明白在另个地方，有的人和我外貌不同，有着蓝色，绿色的眼睛，还有黄黄卷卷的头发。他们说着我听不懂的话，吃的和我不同。我在白天时候他们却是黑夜，我在夏天喝冰水其他人可能在冬天的被窝里。我们之间可能有海或者一块很大的陆地。 那么自然就会出现遐想，为什么有白天黑夜的区别？为什么隔着海？为什么还有陆地？这里就有了地理的启蒙。这样我知道了球形的地球给我们造成白天黑夜的原因。 而这个过程是必须有人启发引导的，就好像也需要去别人问我为什么外国人长得格外不一样？ 如果我能明白美不是特定的，不是白肤白为美，皮黑为陋，应该是如果每个人都能这样，那该多好，为什么说话我们听不懂？就会涉及到基本的历史，并且我可能在人生第一次知道“文明”不仅仅是讲卫生。还有这样才知道世界上外语不止有英语，就好像知道中国不只有普通话。 哪怕对世界是这么模糊的概念，最起码初中可以清楚为什么学时区，学季风气候，学公转自转的概念。 如果主动询问为什么人类生活不是从一开始就这样的，如果让我幻想自己被遗弃在没有人的没有电没有火地方怎么生存。那么我会不会不会考虑所有的房子，车子，房子里的空调，沙发上玩具怎么来的？那么就可能会知道什么是且为什么有工业革命了。而这一切都是地理，历史的巧妙结合。在这里我可能选择对科技感兴趣，对那时候人生活状态感兴趣，或者最起码在玩手机的时候知道里面的东西要感谢谁，大概怎么来的。 再继续如果意识到自己学的国家历史只是世界上一部分，会不会考虑其他部分是什么状态呢？为什么别的国家崇拜上帝呢？上帝和如来都是怎么回事啊？那么这可能是对世界史提起兴趣的起源。如果这时候又有人能够引导去看古希腊，罗马历史甚至哲学。 那么我可能会知道欧洲，中东部分国家领土的变化是如此之大，然后对比朝代的更替。他能知道入侵，内部分解导致结果的不同之处，那么这时我可能会产生对东西文化不同的兴趣。 如果能到这里没有偏见，在基础理科知识具备的状态下探寻现代技术产生的背景，比如电怎么来的？火车怎么来的？（如果我问火车怎么到中国来的，那么我还会继续深究历史。如果我问火车轨道全世界是不是相同的，那么我可能对经济产生兴趣）空调怎么来的？ 那么就会知道我所学的知识到底是针对前人的具体问题。而这个问题的背景又是一段历史，那么这个历史极大可能包括贸易，战争，技术革命。这时候如果我能读类似杜兰特的书籍，又或者他痴迷于先有鸡和蛋的问题，那么我也可能去读罗素。这其中的无数次可能都需要指点。年轻的时候，指点只能靠别人，而这个被指点过程中自身对知识获取和其中的思考就是一种逻辑探讨，这种逻辑也造就了我的真正独立。 这时很明显已经从人类普遍的好奇到了个人对事物不同面的探究，而这就是大学前我选择专业的动机！ 而这一切的前提，就是不要觉得自己的东西才是最好的，最好还能真正有平等的概念。但是也很明显，这样读书我是考不到大学的！ 备注（2021）：再次看到，可耻于当年（也包括现在）“文字”功底是非常差的备注（2023） 当年可耻的有点早，现在依旧非常差，放弃执念，努力赚钱吧 影响我的-文章写于2018年5月 昨天的一口呼吸、一个眼神都造就了今天不同的我，确实这是个很虚的话题，所以”感谢爸妈，不忘国家“这里就不说了。 让我变得深夜矫情的一定是读书了，阅读的第一本比较人文社科的书籍就是徐中约的《近代中国史》，且不得不说影响很大。抛开小说和专业课本，大学毕业前我不读一书。第二本是杜兰特的，刷新了三观，或许本来也没有“三观”，只是形容下觉得书真的有作用，无论作用的正反。再之后的资中筠，郑也夫，周教授，秦教授，让我突然变得像”文科生”一样，当然肯定不如文科生，我是觉得和自己对”自己”的定义已经不同了,虽然此时的我仍不记得”五代十国”发生过什么。 我偶尔也问自己有没有信仰，信仰究竟是概念的还是物质的？也许林语堂是个很好的例子，保持对世界的探索，直到不惑甚至耄耋之年再做决定也不迟。 特别希望有人可以和我谈书（说实话直到2023年7月把这篇文章整理前，我依旧没有完成当年的读书誓言，惭愧），有次和公司同事聊天，他说到特别喜欢孟德斯鸠的法的精神，先情后法，先法后情…云云。心中知道自己是没资格聊看书的，如果十年前就广泛涉及，就不会出现现在的只言片语（尴尬了，还是一样，5年过去了），破碎的知识体系，同时真的佩服那些名牌大学的出身，披戴皇冠是曾承其重，且不说自己如何后来居上，只盼可望其项背！ 说到看书，我们也喜欢把看书剧情化，以为是白衣书生，文邹邹的谈吐，又或者是图书馆的男女神，多么优雅的姿势，多么精致的书本，多么文艺的背景，其实蹲在马桶上不才是最舒服的姿势吗？我以前写过对读书的想法，实在是半瓶子醋，可以饭桌不说，挚友不说，好友不说，但不写有时候真的很难受。 一百年不到的时光在世上走一遭，你以为了解一切，侃侃而谈，百年之后你的行为是荒唐的存在，百年以后你我都不知，但如果真的发生了那岂不是太悲哀了。或者你觉得一切复杂，愿意低头吃饭，倘若你真舍得。审视一下每个人，以自己为中心，到家庭，好友圈，天气预报圈，民族，国家，世界，我们到底把思维扩散到了哪个范围？又了解到了什么地步？ 有人说自己都不了解自己，其实自己不可能不了解自己。无非两种，不愿意表达实施自己的想法，自己都不想承认接受自己的想法。即使是矛盾的人，也是因为自己的想法和对客观存在理性分析产生的冲突，总而言之，人始终知道自己的想法，只是外界的影响导致以上两种。基于这点一个人出生就会从自我考虑，而且随着与外界的接触，开始通过对外界的判断来调节自己的想法，想法也从这里开始复杂。 其实一般人只要扩散到了好友圈，基本上就可以活的很自在了。晒东晒西也是基于这点……能到天气预报圈的就一定是个一官半职了，如果再扩散就一定涉及到历史观，政治意识，真理道德等等。 止于此会很幸福。文章也止于此吧！ 记“帮人” -文章写于2023年7月在这边中国超市购物的时候碰到了一个家长带着孩子来旅游，大概是庆祝结束的高考假期。 听了一会他们大概是问老板这边去另一个小镇的公交车哪些班次。华人老板大概也给了几个选项但好像还是不满足和家长的预期。 因为我之前去过，便随口而出“直接去谷歌搜下路线就行了，一天大概有5班” 家长好像抓住了救命稻草说“哎呀，我也查了，这不啥也没查到”，他把手机拿给我看，我怎么也没想到他是在“今日头条”上查的。 我能想到的很多中年人出国以后依旧坚持“百度”，但是没想到今日头条也成了“搜索引擎”了。 这种情况我知道已经无法解释了，于是想给他装一个谷歌导航，好歹以后这个软件能帮忙。但是把手机拿来以后商店里找不到这款软件。无奈我只能把网址直接输入到浏览器，然后设置一个快捷方式到手机桌面。 无任何种原因，每个人眼前都是充满了无数道墙。 就像我永远忘记不了，我的导师曾经不可思议地看着我“我不敢想象一个工科生不会使用Matlab”

回到正文，我们怎么利用OE的数据来判断该需求的竞争程度呢？了解经济学的应该直到HHI这个参数。以下来自网络解释 12345678910111213141516171819赫希曼指数（Herfindahl-Hirschman Index，简称HHI）是用于衡量市场竞争程度的指标，常用于经济学和产业组织领域。它的计算基于市场上各个企业的市场份额，越高的HHI值表示市场上企业较少，市场竞争较为弱化；反之，较低的HHI值表示市场上有较多的企业，市场竞争较为激烈。HHI的计算公式如下：HHI = Σ(s_i)^2其中，s_i表示第i家企业的市场份额（市场份额的计算通常以销售额或市场份额的比例来衡量），Σ表示对所有企业求和。在行业中，HHI通常会乘以1000，所以HHI的取值范围为0到10,000，对应不同的市场竞争程度：HHI &lt; 1,500：市场高度竞争，存在大量竞争对手。垄断度低1,500 ≤ HHI &lt; 2,500：市场竞争中等，存在一些大型竞争对手。中等垄断度HHI ≥ 2,500：市场竞争较弱，市场主要由少数几家大型企业垄断。高度垄断HHI可以用于评估某个特定市场的竞争状况，也可用于比较不同市场之间的竞争程度。政府和监管机构有时会使用HHI来评估市场竞争程度，以便做出相关政策和法规的决策。 注意，高度竞争意味着活跃市场，反之意味着垄断市场（这个一开始可能有点反直觉）。这和运营抱怨”竞争太激烈“可能不是一回事。以上，如果表格能力可以的人应该直到怎么去做了，但是对于表格能力比较差的，我会提供一个表格实例。先解释OE常见的指标之一’买家需求’。 Customer Need - 符合买家某种需求的类似商品被称为一个“细分市场” 细细品味这句话，亚马逊是如何进行分类的我们不得而知，但我们我们分析的系统就是基于某一个细分市场，细分市场的组成单位就是一个个的ASIN及其品牌，我们针对品牌或者细分到ASIN进行公式书写就可以得到HHI指标。如果你觉得多个细分市场都是你的标定市场，你可以下载两个数据进行合并。 如果会DAX可以直接使用 1234567891011HHI = VAR TotalClicks = SUM(&#x27;Opportunity Explorer&#x27;[Click count])VAR BrandClickShares = SUMMARIZE(&#x27;Opportunity Explorer&#x27;, &#x27;Opportunity Explorer&#x27;[Brand], &quot;ClickShare&quot;, SUM(&#x27;Opportunity Explorer&#x27;[Click count]))VAR ClickShareSquares = SUMX( BrandClickShares, [ClickShare] ^ 2 )RETURN ClickShareSquares / TotalClicks ^ 2 但是对于非数据分析师，用EXCEL也是可以解决的，我们先把数据粘贴到sheet1 为了便于演示，我把clickcount 采用了随机数，实际使用删除粘贴你们自己的数据即可。 接下来，dashboard单元格会自动出现三种分类的垄断度数据（集中度)，采用透视表也可以，不过需要手动刷新数据，所以使用了UNIQUE 和SUMIF函数，这样可以自动计算，优于透视表。 分别为 品牌点击垄断度 类目点击集中度 ASIN点击集中度 表格下载链接onedrive

In other words, the p-value gives us an idea of how likely it is that we would observe the data we have if there were no real underlying effect. In this blog post, we will break down the concept of the p-value, explain how it’s calculated, and provide examples to help you better understand and interpret p-values in your own research. 2. The Null Hypothesis and the Alternative HypothesisBefore we dive into p-values, it’s important to understand the concept of hypothesis testing. In a hypothesis test, two opposing hypotheses are presented: Null Hypothesis (H0): This hypothesis states that there is no significant difference between the observed effect and the expected effect. In other words, any effect observed in the data is due to random chance. Alternative Hypothesis (H1): This hypothesis states that there is a significant difference between the observed effect and the expected effect. In other words, the effect observed in the data is not due to random chance, but rather due to an underlying cause. Our goal in hypothesis testing is to determine whether we should accept or reject the null hypothesis based on the data we have collected. 3. Calculating the p-valueThe p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one calculated from our data, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. To calculate the p-value, we follow these steps: Assume that the null hypothesis is true. Calculate the test statistic from the data. Determine the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the calculated test statistic, assuming the null hypothesis is true. This probability is the p-value. In general, the formula for calculating the p-value is: p-value = P(T &gt; t | H0) where T is the test statistic, t is the observed value of the test statistic, and H0 is the null hypothesis. 4. Interpreting the p-valueAfter calculating the p-value, we compare it to a predetermined significance level (α), which is usually set at 0.05. The significance level represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it’s true. If the p-value is less than or equal to α (p ≤ α), we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. In this case, we consider the observed effect to be statistically significant. If the p-value is greater than α (p &gt; α), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. In this case, we consider the observed effect to be statistically insignificant and attribute it to random chance. 5. Examples of p-value in real-life situationsExample 1: Testing a new drugA pharmaceutical company wants to test the effectiveness of a new drug designed to lower blood pressure. They set up a clinical trial with a control group and a treatment group. The null hypothesis is that the drug has no significant effect on blood pressure, while the alternative hypothesis is that the drug does have a significant effect. After the trial, the researchers calculate a p-value of 0.03. Since the p-value is less than the significance level of 0.05, they reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the drug has a significant effect on blood pressure. Example 2: Examining the relationship between two variablesA researcher is studying the relationship between hours spent studying and test scores. The null hypothesis is that there is no significant relationship between the two variables, while the alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant relationship. After analyzing the data, the researcher calculates a p-value of 0.08. Since the p-value is greater than the significance level of 0.05, they fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant relationship between hours spent studying and test scores. 6. ConclusionThe p-value is a crucial concept in hypothesis testing and statistical analysis. It allows us to determine whether an observed effect ina dataset is likely due to random chance or an underlying cause. By comparing the p-value to a predetermined significance level, we can decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis, which ultimately helps us make informed decisions based on our data. It’s essential to remember that a low p-value does not prove that the null hypothesis is false. It only indicates that, given the data, the observed effect is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone. Additionally, a high p-value does not prove that the null hypothesis is true. It simply suggests that the data does not provide sufficient evidence to reject it. As researchers, we must always consider the context and limitations of our studies when interpreting p-values and drawing conclusions.","categories":[{"name":"Data","slug":"Data","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/categories/Data/"}],"tags":[{"name":"share","slug":"share","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/share/"},{"name":"Data Analyst","slug":"Data-Analyst","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/Data-Analyst/"}]},{"title":"Blasting parameters design for open-pit","slug":"Blasting parameters design for open-pit","date":"2023-05-21T22:00:00.000Z","updated":"2024-04-07T17:53:03.181Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/05/22/Blasting parameters design for open-pit/","link":"","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/2023/05/22/Blasting%20parameters%20design%20for%20open-pit/","excerpt":"此工具为2016年冬天根据史老师培训课程整理所得，演讲文稿已注明所有计算均基于经验公式。对于不常见情形的参数请谨慎参考！","text":"此工具为2016年冬天根据史老师培训课程整理所得，演讲文稿已注明所有计算均基于经验公式。对于不常见情形的参数请谨慎参考！ form { margin-bottom: 20px;

They are a subset of heavy-tailed distributions. It’s easy to visualize the idea of a long tailed function, and slightly harder to make it concrete. If we want to be rigorous, though, there is a exact mathematical definition of a long tailed function (Foss et. al, 2013): (ultimately positive) function f is defined according to a limit —a term introduced in calculus. Very basically, the limit tells you where the distribution converges to at a certain point. In this case, if the ratio of x + y and x converge to 1 as the x-values get much larger, then the distribution is long-tailed: e long tailed property of distributions carries over into many derivative distributions. If f1, f2… fn are all long tailed, then: Any distribution that can be expressed as a product of these, fx&#x3D; f1 · f2… · fn is also long tailed. Any distribution that can be expressed as a linear combination of these is long tailed. That means that any function Commerce and marketing schemes often find that there sales can best be modeled by long tail distributions. For instance, an internet store may have certain items with very high sales (modeled by the center of the distribution curve) and a large number of items with much lower sales (modeled by the long tail). Although the sales volume for every individual item in the tail may be negligible, there are enough items that they play a significant role in the general profit taking. In fact, the profit from low-sale volume items can rival or even sometimes leave in the dust the profit made from best-sellers—provided only the tail is long enough. 1.3长尾分布应用在电商平台1.3.1 亚马逊平台对于大部分的行业软件，如卖家精灵，数派，基本上是根据反比例函数结合机器学习来根据Bsr 排名的权重来反推销量。 To people that don’t understand them, they manifest as ‘unfairness’, which they are. Unlike normal distributions, long tailed phenomena do not centre around a mid-point. They’re totally unsymmetrical and extreme events are rare, unpredictable but have gargantuan impacts when they eventually occur. There are two models that we can use to map-out how these long-tailed distributions occur. Preferential attachment: Imagine a network consisting of nodes and connections between nodes. The more connected a node is, the more likely it is to receive new links [3]. Preferential attachment often plays out in social domains. Looking at Instagram as an example, if you think about accounts as nodes and followers as connections; the more followers an account has, the more likely it is to receive more followers. The distribution of followers across social media accounts is a likely long tailed. Self-organized Criticality: Imagine an empty N by N grid. A random site on the grid is chosen, if empty the site grows a tree with a probability g. If a site contains a tree lightening hits the site with a probability of (1-g). The lightening struck tree catches fire and the fire spreads to all connected trees[1]. In plain English, most forest fires are small but there exists a point where the forest becomes so dense that a fire could be gigantic. Here’s a cool simulation of self-organized criticality playing out in the forest fire model. Taking earthquakes as an example of a phenomenon that roughly follows a power law distribution with an exponent of 2[1]. An earthquake of magnitude 9 would be the size of the 2011 earthquake in Honshu Japan. It was estimated to have killed around 29,000 people and damaged nuclear reactors [5]. According to our assumptions about the distribution of earthquakes, an earthquake of this magnitude occurs with a probability of around one-in-a-million each day. Across 1 century this one in a million event has a probability of occurrence of around 3.5%. Given the devastation that it could cause, suddenly this seems very concerning. It becomes even more so when you realise that the most earthquakes are between 5–5.9 on the Richter scale [6], a-thousand to ten-thousand times weaker than our one-in-a-million event. Lack of awareness of long tailed phenomena will cause governments to be ill-prepared for these extreme events leading to mass destruction. 在亚马逊提供给我们的ABA数据中，也是可以根据ABA的排名进行搜索量反推的 利用ABA数据反推市场容量就是利用这样的逻辑，从数据类型说，我们把定序尺度转化成了定比尺度。 1.3.2 二项分布在广告的应用基础知识对于离散随机变量，有一个最重要的概率分布，它是 二项分布 (binomial distribution) 。二项分布处于二元数据。因为二元数据的情况非常多，所以二项分布使用频繁。 二项分布的三个要素。首先，试验现象有两种结果，并且成功概率是常量。这种实验被称为 伯努利试验验 (Bernoulli trial) 。其次，你观察试验结果 n 次。第三，你对成功的结果计数，记为 x 。这三个元素被结合成一个公式，它给出了在 n 次试验中取得特定数量成功结果的概率。公式如下： $P (x) &#x3D; \\frac {n!}{x!(n - x)!} p^x (1 - p)^{n-x}, x &#x3D; 0,1,2,…,n$ 概率质量函数 累积分布函数 二项分布是一个离散概率分布，用于只有两个独立互斥结果的随机变量 —— 成功或者失败。它给出了对于随机变量的 n 个结果，其中 x 个成功的概率。也叫做试验成功的概率。 二项分布假定所有试验的概率 p 都是固定的，它的均值等于 n 乘以 p ，标准差等于 n 乘以 p 乘以 (1 - p)，然后求平方根。 二项分布根据 p 的变化可以向右或者向左偏斜，或者对称。当 p 接近 0 时是右偏态，当 p 接近 1 时是左偏态。二项分布公式如下： $P (x) &#x3D; \\frac {n!}{x!(n - x)!} p^x (1 - p)^{n-x}, x &#x3D; 0,1,2,…,n$ 速记为 X∼B(N,P) 二项分布的累积概率分布公式如下： $F (x) &#x3D; P (X \\leq x) &#x3D; \\sum_{k &#x3D; 0}^{x} \\frac {n!}{k!(n - k)!} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}$ 1.3.3 对广告点击和转化的运用为了解释这个问题，我们依然要接受一个和现实不会完全相符的假设，即：一个产品的转化率不会因为客户的不同和时间的不同而发生变化。 对于产品转化率为10%的一个关键词，意味着每一次点击的并且出单的概率是10%，不出单的概率的90%。 在这样的假设下，广告的点击出单概率即转化率可以近似看成二项分布。 一个转化率10%的词究竟会在第几次出单？出单的概率多大？ 上图可以回答这个问题 如果在某次点击后依旧没有出单，那么他为10%转化率的概率究竟还有多大？ EXCEL可以利用以下算法实现假设检验的概率计算 1=(IFERROR(BINOM.DIST(C$7,$B9,$C$5,FALSE),&quot;&quot;) 这里需要的就是假设检验，即假设转化率为10%的情况下，某个点击次数下，订单为具体数值的概率为多大。 EXCEL可以利用以下算法实现假设检验的概率计算 12345678910111213=IF((1-IF(C7&lt;=ROUNDUP(B7*$C$1,0),BINOM.DIST.RANGE(B7,$C$1,C7,ROUNDUP(B7*$C$1,0)),BINOM.DIST.RANGE(B7,$C$1,C7)))&lt;0.5,BINOM.DIST.RANGE(B7,$C$1,0,C7),1-IF(C7&lt;=ROUNDUP(B7*$C$1,0),BINOM.DIST.RANGE(B7,$C$1,C7,ROUNDUP(B7*$C$1,0)),BINOM.DIST.RANGE(B7,$C$1,C7))) 1.3.4延申思考由于概率分布的特性，现实中我们应该关注广告的累计转化率，而不是具体的某个时间点的分布，因为点击数较小的情况下，你求出来的转化率未必是产品的真实转化率。 在累计转化率相同的情况下，通过多次数据模拟也可以发现不一样的累计转化率走向，如果不理解这个道理，很容对表现相同的产品做出完全不同的方案。 1.4 莱温斯特编辑距离和关键词相关性判断基础知识莱文斯坦距离，又称Levenshtein距离，是编辑距离（edit distance）的一种。是描述由一个字串转化成另一个字串最少的编辑操作次数，其中的操作包括插入、删除和替换。 举例： 例如将kitten一字转成sitting： sitten（k替换为→s） sittin （e替换为→i） sitting （添加→g） 那么二者的编辑距离为3。 通过和字符串长度建立相对距离，可以帮助我们判断相似性 1.4.1 实际应用 VBA代码 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162636465666768697071727374Function Levenshtein3(ByVal string1 As String, ByVal string2 As String) As LongDim i As Long, j As Long, string1_length As Long, string2_length As LongDim distance(0 To 60, 0 To 50) As Long, smStr1(1 To 60) As Long, smStr2(1 To 50) As LongDim min1 As Long, min2 As Long, min3 As Long, minmin As Long, MaxL As Longstring1_length = Len(string1): string2_length = Len(string2)distance(0, 0) = 0For i = 1 To string1_length: distance(i, 0) = i: smStr1(i) = Asc(LCase(Mid$(string1, i, 1))): NextFor j = 1 To string2_length: distance(0, j) = j: smStr2(j) = Asc(LCase(Mid$(string2, j, 1))): NextFor i = 1 To string1_length For j = 1 To string2_length If smStr1(i) = smStr2(j) Then distance(i, j) = distance(i -

In this context, “reading” refers to the act of obtaining information through text-based media, which may or may not have an impact on the reader. To be considered as reading, the following elements are essential: Text-based media: The source of information must be in a written format. Obtaining information: The purpose of reading is to gain knowledge and understanding. Potential impact: Reading can lead to insights and new perspectives.","text":"How to Approach “Reading”IntroductionBefore delving into the topic of “reading,” let’s establish its connotation, extension, and the boundaries of our discussion. In this context, “reading” refers to the act of obtaining information through text-based media, which may or may not have an impact on the reader. To be considered as reading, the following elements are essential: Text-based media: The source of information must be in a written format. Obtaining information: The purpose of reading is to gain knowledge and understanding. Potential impact: Reading can lead to insights and new perspectives. Example 1Consider a physics book that explains the mechanics of object movement. Engaging with the book may result in two outcomes: Lack of understanding: Mere scanning of the text without comprehension does not qualify as reading. True reading requires understanding and assimilation of the content. Knowledge acquisition: When you comprehend the principles of object movement, you are genuinely “reading.” This understanding may lead to insights, such as grasping why high-speed cars have longer braking distances and why bicycles remain stable during motion. “To Read or Not to Read”Let’s disregard the issue of not understanding, as it does not constitute genuine reading. I categorize reading into three types: Reading as Input: This involves exploring text to stimulate thinking and generate unpredictable insights. It can be akin to engaging with AI language models, where the input may be influenced by external factors, like educational reading clubs or recommendations from others. Pros: It can lead to enlightening revelations and epiphanies. Cons: Controlled input may result in limited output and potential “brainwashing.” Advice: To avoid being passively confined to a certain type of reading, diversify your reading choices by pairing mainstream books with controversial ones. Reading as a Tool: Here, reading is a pragmatic approach used to find solutions to specific problems. It offers a systematic and accurate understanding of issues, making it effective in problem-solving, especially for broad topics. Pros: It can provide quick and comprehensive solutions to problems. Cons: It may lack timeliness for cutting-edge issues, where forums could be more efficient. Advice: Prioritize books that align with your background and needs. Reading as a Habit: This type of reading resembles watching TV, where it becomes a habitual activity. Developing a reading habit, particularly with non-fiction books, is commendable as it aids in information absorption. Advice: I have limited exposure to this type, so no specific advice is offered. In summary, if you do not seek personal growth, transformation, or problem-solving through reading, and if reading does not interest you, it may not be necessary for you. SuggestionsIn a world where high-quality information is scarce, reading stands as the most effective means of obtaining knowledge. It broadens our horizons, deepens our understanding, and nurtures personal growth. Therefore, embracing reading as a valuable method of gaining information is highly beneficial.","categories":[{"name":"Personal","slug":"Personal","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/categories/Personal/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Life","slug":"Life","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/Life/"},{"name":"Reading","slug":"Reading","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/Reading/"}]},{"title":"从亚马逊角度思考广告逻辑","slug":"amazon00","date":"2021-06-13T22:00:00.000Z","updated":"2024-04-07T17:52:16.457Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/06/14/amazon00/","link":"","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/2021/06/14/amazon00/","excerpt":"Avenue &#x3D; Clicks(ad) × CVR(ad) × Price × commission + Clicks(n) × CVR(n) × Price × commission + Clicks(ad) × PPC Avenue: 亚马逊的总收益 Clicks(ad)：广告点击（简化为亚马逊的广告流量） CVR(ad)：广告转化率 Price：产品价格 commission：佣金比例 clicks(n)：自然点击 CVR(n)：自然转化率 PPC：点击广告付费","text":"Avenue &#x3D; Clicks(ad) × CVR(ad) × Price × commission + Clicks(n) × CVR(n) × Price × commission + Clicks(ad) × PPC Avenue: 亚马逊的总收益 Clicks(ad)：广告点击（简化为亚马逊的广告流量） CVR(ad)：广告转化率 Price：产品价格 commission：佣金比例 clicks(n)：自然点击 CVR(n)：自然转化率 PPC：点击广告付费 流量对亚马逊来说是资源，平台一共就那么多流量，怎么分配呢？把所有的流量点击数作为亚麻的资源成本。Cost &#x3D;TotalClicks&#x3D; Clicks(ad)+Clicks(n) 左右除以总点击数（成本） 左边等于流量的利润率 Profit &#x3D; ad × (CVR(ad) × Price × Commission+PPC)+n × CVR(n) × Commission × PriceProfit &#x3D; ad × (CVR(ad) × Price × Commission+PPC)+(1-ad) × CVR(n) × Commission × Price移除佣金这种常量，定义收益函数 F(ProfitAmazon) &#x3D; ad × (CVR(ad) × Price+PPC)+(1-ad) × CVR(n) × Price假设广告转化率等于自然转化率，在点击数够大确实如此。when the clicks is as infinite, the CVR(ad) &#x3D; CVR(n)F(ProfitAmazon) &#x3D; CR × Price+ad × PPC ad is the proportion of ad clicks 从亚马逊角度，如果所有的出单都来自于广告收益最大，因为除了佣金还存在广告收费，但是卖家不会愿意花那么多钱进行投广告，所以这是博弈的过程。卖家的广告费用占比必然低于产品的利润率。For seller, they control the ad below this critical value 卖家不会把所有的钱用来推广广告。 ad × (ppc&#x2F;Price × CR)&lt;Profit$(s)ad&lt;Profit&#x2F;(ppc × CR&#x2F;Price)(s)&#x3D;（Profit × Price × CR)&#x2F;PPCF(ProfitAmazon)&lt;CR × Price+Profit(seller) × Price × CRF(ProfitAmazon)&lt;CR × Price(1+Profit(seller))所以亚马逊会把流量给转化高，价格高，利润率高（BID承受值大）的产品。懒得讲了，绕了一大圈其实就是常说的几乎话。","categories":[{"name":"Data","slug":"Data","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/categories/Data/"}],"tags":[{"name":"tools","slug":"tools","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/tools/"},{"name":"跨境","slug":"跨境","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/%E8%B7%A8%E5%A2%83/"}]}],"categories":[{"name":"Personal","slug":"Personal","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/categories/Personal/"},{"name":"Data","slug":"Data","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/categories/Data/"},{"name":"Engineer","slug":"Engineer","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/categories/Engineer/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Share","slug":"Share","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/Share/"},{"name":"share","slug":"share","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/share/"},{"name":"Life","slug":"Life","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/Life/"},{"name":"tools","slug":"tools","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/tools/"},{"name":"跨境","slug":"跨境","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/%E8%B7%A8%E5%A2%83/"},{"name":"Data Analyst","slug":"Data-Analyst","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/Data-Analyst/"},{"name":"工作感悟","slug":"工作感悟","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E6%84%9F%E6%82%9F/"},{"name":"Reading","slug":"Reading","permalink":"https://ilyfei.com/tags/Reading/"}]}
